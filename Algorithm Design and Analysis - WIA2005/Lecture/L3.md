### Classification of Sorting Algorithm
1. In-place vs Not-In-Place
2. Stable vs Not Stable
3. Adaptive vs Non-Adaptive
4. Online vs Offline
	- Online Sort : 
		- Example : Kahoot Game Score Leaderboard

| Algorithm     | In-place? | Stable? | Adaptive? | Online? |
|---------------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Bubble sort   | Yes       | Yes     | Yes       | No      |
| Counting sort | No        | Yes     | No        | No      |
| Radix Sort    | No        | Yes     | No        | No      |
| Bucket sort   | No        | Yes     | No        | No      |
| Shell sort    | Yes       | No      | Yes       | No      |

### Bubble Sort
```python
BUBBLESORT(A)
	for i = 1 to A.length - 1
		for j = A.lenght downto i + 1
			if A[j] < A[j-1]
				exchange A[j]
```

$$T(n) = \theta(n^2)$$

### Counting Sort
```python
COUNTING-SORT(A, B, k)
let C [0... k] be a new array
for i = 0 to k
	C[i] = 0
for j= 1 to A.length
// C [i] now contains the number of elements equal to i.
for i = 1to k
	C[i] = +C[i-1]
// C [i] now contains the number of elements less than or equal to i.
for j = A. length downto 1
	B[C[A[j]]] = A[j]
	C[A[j]] = C[A[j]] - 1
```

$$T(n) = \theta(n+k)$$
Disadvantage
- if the number got large range of number then C array will be big
- cannot use for floating

### Radix Sort
```python
RADIX-SORT(A,d)
	use a stable sort to sort array A on digit i
```

$$T(n) = \theta [d(n+k)]$$

### Buckle Sort
```python
let B[0..n-1] be a new ray
n = A.length
for i = 0 to n - 1
	make B[i] an empty list
for i = 1 to n
	insert A[i] into list B[[nA[i]]]
for i = 0 
```


$$T(n)=\theta(n)$$
Assumption : 
- Input number are ~U in [0,1)

### Shell Sort
- is used because when there is gap the insertion is much faster
$T(n) = \theta(n log n)$ until $T(n) = \theta(n^2)$
