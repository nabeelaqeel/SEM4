## A: Understand Recursive Algorithm (MIT Book Chapter 2)

- Recursive algorithms typically follow divide and conquer approach. Let's see what is divide and conquer approach.

- In this course, we will look at 2 types of algorithms
	- Iterative : Last week
	- Recursive : This week
	- Which one is better?

### Revision
- If a program has no iteration/recursive – running time is constant O(1)
- Problems that can be solve with iterative, can be solve using recursion as well, and vice versa.
- However, the way to analyze the time complexity of iterative algorithm and recursive algorithm is different.

### Divide and Conquer Approach
- If the problem is easy, solve it directly. But if the problem cannot be solved as is, break it into smaller parts. Solve the smaller parts!
- A divide and conquer strategy, also known as “divide and rule strategy” is often applied in military. In this strategy, one power breaks another power into smaller, more manageable pieces, and then takes control of those pieces one by one.

- Break the problem into several sub-problems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size, solve the problem recursively , and then combine these solutions to create a solution of the original problem.
