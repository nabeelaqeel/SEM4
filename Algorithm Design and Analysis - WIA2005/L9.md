# Greedy Algorithms and Graph (Part 1)

### Learning Objectives
- About Greedy algorithms 
	- Activity Selection problem
	- Knapsack problem.
	- Data compression problem using Huffman code

## Greedy Algorithms
- A greedy algorithm always choose the best solution at the moment.
- Make locally optimal choice at each stage, with the hope of finding a global optimal solution.
- Greedy algorithms can resolve optimization problems. What is optimization problem?
	- Problems which require minimum results (minimization problem) – Example, you want to cover a journey in minimum cost / you want to travel in minimum distance to reach a destination.
	 - Problems which require maximum results (maximization problem) – Example, a thief wants to steal maximum value of item in the knapsack problem / to select a maximum number of activities in the An activity-selection problem
- For each problem, there can only be more than 1 feasible solutions. BUT, only 1 optimal solution (Cannot have multiple optimal solutions)
- Pros: simple, easy to implement, fast.
- Cons: may not provide a global optimum solution in the end.
