# Algorithm Design and Analysis

### Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)
At the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Apply the suitable algorithmic-paradigms to design efficient algorithm. 
2. Evaluate efficiency by calculating the performance of algorithms: T(n).
3. Exploit advance-data-structures to reduce T(n).
4. Integrate multiple algorithms to resolve real-life problems using Python programming language (group project).

# Introduction to Algorithm Design & Analysis Fundamentals (Part 1)

### Learning Objectives
- A: Know what is the role of algorithm in computing (MIT Book Chapter 1) to:
- B: Understand iterative algorithms (MIT Book Chapter 2)
- C: Analyze time complexity of iterative algorithms (MIT Book Chapter 2)
- D: Know what is growth of function (MIT Book Chapter 3)

### What is Algorithm?
- Algorithm is computational steps to be followed for computer to solve problems
- Algorithm as tool for solving a well-specified computational problem
- Input : Algorithm takes some value OR set of values as input 
	- aka instance problem 
- Output : Algorithm produces some value OR set of values as output
	- aka solution to a problem

### Input to an Algorithm
Input size = number of items in the input, n.
Examples of input:
1. Array size of n for sorting. Example, sort A = {31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58} to ascending order. The input size of this array is 6, as there are 6 items in array A.
2. Total number of bits needed to represent the input. Example, multiplying 4 and 5. The input size is 2.
3. Input to an algorithm can also be a graph. In this case, the input size is the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
