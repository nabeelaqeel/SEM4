# THREAT ACTORS AND DEFENDERS

### Cybersecurity at a glance
- Cybersecurity?
	- Protecting critical systems and sensitive information from digital attacks (IBM). 
	- Designed to combat threats against networked systems and applications, whether those threats originate from inside or outside of an organization.
- Why is it important?
	- Recent high profile data breaches in Malaysia
	- Internet scams
	- Ransomwares

### Threat Actors
- Includes but not limited to the following:
	- Amateurs
	- Hacktivist
	- Organized crime group
	- State-sponsored
- What are their motivations?'

### Threat Impacts
- What are they looking for?
	- Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
		- Name
		- Phone number
	- Protected Health Information (PHI)
		- EMR
	- Personal Security Information (PSI)
		- Credentials
- Which consequently leads to:
	- Lost competitive advantage
	- Politics and national security
	- Financial
- What other impacts?

### Defending Against Threats
- What are the entities/agencies in the country that deal with cybersecurity incidents?
	- Cybersecurity Malaysia (CSM)
	- others?
- What are the approaches/solutions in defending against cyber threats?
	- Security Operations Center (SOC)
		- Centralized facility to monitor, detect and respond to cyber security incidents (in real time).
		- Typically consists of a group of security professionals:
			- Blue team
			- Red team
			- What other colours?

		- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212153449.png)
		- People In The SOC
			- Tier 1 Analyst
				- monitor incoming alerts, verify that a true incident has occurred, and forward tickets to Tier 2, if necessary
			- Tier 2 Incident Responder
				- responsible for deep investigation of incidents and advise remediation or action to be taken.
			- Tier 3 Threat Hunter
				- expert-level skill in network, endpoint, threat intelligence, and malware reverse engineering.
				- experts at tracing the processes of the malware to determine its impact and how it can be removed
				- deeply involved in hunting for potential threats and implementing threat detection tools.

		- Technologies In The SOC
			- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
				- Making sense of security data e.g., logs, alerts
				- Used for collecting and filtering data, detecting and classifying threats, and analyzing and investigating threats.
			- Other technologies include:
				- Event collection, correlation, and analysis
				- Log management
				- Vulnerability assessment
				- Vulnerability tracking
				- Threat intelligence
		- SOC Metrics
			- Metrics or KPI is important to gauge SOC performance.
				- `Dwell Time` – the length of time that threat actors have access to a network before they are detected, and their access is stopped.
				- `Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)` – the average time that it takes for the SOC personnel to identify valid security incidents have occurred in the network.
				- `Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)` – the average time that it takes to stop and remediate a security incident.
				- `Mean Time to Contain (MTTC)` – the time required to stop the incident from causing further damage to systems or data.
				- `Time to Control` – the time required to stop the spread of malware in the network.


### Security vs Availability
- Revisit the fundamental security concept: CIA
	- Confidentiality
	- Integrity
	- Availability
- Can we have all three?
- What are the trade offs?

### Key Takeaways
- Cybersecurity is key in today’s world.
- There are different threat actors with various motivations.
- Threat impacts vary but cause negative implications to all organizations.
- SOC and SOAR are two main technologies in defending against threats.
