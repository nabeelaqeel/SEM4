Algo:
Final Exam 
no probabilistic Analysis
no divide & conquer

No coding at all for final, 3 question each 10 marks, chatgpt cannot answer

Uzair:
Dynamic programming, 
greedy algorithm, 
graph programming


IOT:
how to use software (thingsboard): no ask at all
lots of code to write (python, C++)
look through lecture notes (1st, 2nd lecture in Dr. Bryan lecture notes的东西, or one of his lectures)
know pinMode, digitalRead, digitalWrite, delay, analogRead (what it means why is it used)
give code and then draw the circuit 
coding on raspberry pi (40 gpio pins), blinking LED those kinds of things
BMC important topic:
What do you think about the security measure, as a XX, what would you implement, wireless attendance tracker, cost to implement

4 questions 50 marks (2q 15m, 2q 10m)

Cog Sc
25-30 objective questions - may have more than one answer
3-4 subjective questions with sub-questions
-  include one eye-tracking question
- no ask definition question 
- more towards understanding and application questions involving AI with cogsci
- short answers based
- focus on lecture notes, the parts that Dr added and not in the previous semester 
- tutorial questions will not come out the same but the way you answer can be implemented in your final exam answers (?)
- past year questions similar format but questions now are abit technical

OS:
Focused on these 4 chapters:
1) Chapter 2,3,4,6, Concurrency Exercise

 U can find a concurrency exercise on Spectrum (Chap 4 or 6), u need to know how to do that, especially those from Dr SAaIDAL CLASS , ask my student how to do that, u need to know how to do that

Interactive Design:
Human-Centred Design & Interaction Design
Know what human-centred design means: designing systems with users’ needs, goals, and context in mind.
Understand interaction design: how users interact with systems (like using apps, websites, or devices).
Use real-life examples (e.g., mobile apps, ATMs).
Think about how good design improves user experience.
Types of User Interaction
Learn the 4 main types:
Instructing – typing or clicking to give commands (e.g., typing in Google).
Conversing – interacting like a conversation (e.g., chatbots).
Manipulating – moving things around (e.g., dragging files).
Exploring – moving through spaces (e.g., Google Maps).
Be ready to give one example for each.
Cognitive Walkthrough vs. Heuristic Evaluation
Cognitive walkthrough: checks if new users can easily use the system step-by-step.
Heuristic evaluation: experts review design based on usability rules.
Focus on the differences: who does it, how it's done, and when it's useful.
Human Cognition in Design
Review the key parts of human thinking:
Perception, attention, memory, learning, and problem-solving.
Be able to spot which part is used in a design (e.g., bright colors grab attention).
Think about how design helps people think and use systems easily.
Data Gathering Issues
Know at least 5 important issues:
Choosing the right method (urvey, interview, etc.)
Making sure data is honest and accurate.
Respecting privacy and geting consent.
Avoiding bias or leading questions.
Collecting data in the right setting.
Understand why these matter in research.
