# Memory Management: Virtual Memory

### Introduction
- 4 memory allocation schemes:
	- Paged allocation
	- Demand paging allocation
	- Segmented allocation
	- Segmented/demand paged allocation
- Remove the restriction of storing programs contiguously.
- Eliminate the requirement that the entire program reside in memory during execution.

### Paged Memory Allocation
- An incoming job is divided into pages of equal size.
- Sector/block: a section of a disk. 
- Page frame:  a section of main memory.
- For efficiency, pages, sectors and page frames are of the same size.
- One sector holds one page of job instruction and fits into one page frame of memory.
- Before executing a job, the Memory Mgr:
	- Determines the number of pages;
	- Locates enough empty page frames in main memory;
	- Loads the pages (not necessarily contiguously).
- Disadvantage: Memory Mgr must keep track of pages of a program – increases size and complexity of OS.
- Memory Mgr uses three tables to keep track of the pages:
	- Job table (JT);
	- Page map table (PMT);
	- Memory map table (MMT).

### Demand Paging
- Demand paging loads only a part of the program into memory for processing.
- A job is divided into equally sized pages that initially reside in secondary storage.
- When the jobs run, its pages are brought into memory as needed.
- Allows a user to run jobs with less main memory.
- Requires high-speed direct access storage device that can work directly with the CPU.
	- Important because pages must be passed quickly from secondary storage to main memory and back again.
- How and when pages are swapped depends on pre-defined policies that determine when to make room for needed pages and how to do so.

### Page Replacement Policies & Concepts
- The page replacement policy is crucial to the efficiency of the system.
- 2 popular policies:
	- First-in first-out (FIFO);
		- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211142843.png)
		- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211142850.png)
	- Least-recently-used (LRU).
		- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211142900.png)
		- A variation of LRU is the clock page replacement policy.
		- It is implemented as a circular queue and uses a pointer to step through the reference bits of the active pages, simulating a clockwise motion.
		- A page is selected for replacement if its reference bit is 0.
		- If its reference bit is 1, the page is given a second chance and its reference bit is set to 0.
		- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211142924.png)
		- Another variation of LRU uses a 8-bit reference and a bit shifting technique to track the usage of pages in memory.
		- When a page is first copied into memory, the leftmost bit is set to 1; remaining bits are set to 0.
		- At each time tick, the Memory Mgr shifts every page’s reference byte to the right by one.
		- Each time a page is referenced, the leftmost bit is set to 1.
		- The shifting and setting the leftmost bit when a page is referenced gives a history of page usage.

### The Mechanics of Paging
- The Memory Mgr needs specific info about each page in memory in order to swap pages out.

### Working Set
- A failure to find a page in memory is called a page fault. 
- The working set of a job is the set of pages residing in memory that can be accessed directly without incurring a page fault.
- It would be convenient if we could load all the pages of a job’s working set to minimize page faults and to speed up processing.
- 2 issues:
	- How many pages comprise the working set?
	- What is the max number of pages the OS allow for a working set?
- Solution: begin by identifying each job’s working set and then loading them into memory in its entirety before allowing execution to begin.
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211143259.png)
- In time-sharing systems, the OS must keep track of the size and identity of each working set and makes sure jobs for processing do not exceed available memory.
- Some OSs use a variable working set size and increase/decrease it as necessary.

### Advantages of Demand Paging
- It introduced the concept of virtual memory, and hence, jobs are no longer constrained by the size of the physical memory.
- Memory is utilized more efficiently because sections of a job that are seldom used or not at all are not loaded into memory unless they are requested.

### Disadvantages of Demand Paging
- Increased overhead caused by the tables and page interrupts.

### Segmented Memory Allocation 
- Each job is divided into segments of different sizes – one for each module that contains pieces that perform related functions.
- This approach reduces page faults that resulted from having a segment’s loop split over two or more pages.
- Main memory is not divided into page frames – memory is allocated dynamically.
- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211143447.png)
- The Memory Mgr keeps track of segments in the memory using three tables:
	- Job Table
	- Segment Map Table

		- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211143623.png)
		- 
	- Memory Map Table
- What is the difference between paging and segmentation?
	- Pages are physical units that are invisible to the user’s program and of fixed sizes.
	- Segments are logical units that are visible to the user’s program and of variable sizes.


### Segmented/Demand Paged Memory Allocation
- Is a combination of segmentation and demand paging.
- Offers the logical benefits of segmentation and the physical benefits of paging.
- A segment is sub-divided into pages of equal size, smaller than most segment – easier to manipulate.
- Overcomes the problems of segmentations such as compaction, external fragmentation and secondary storage handling.
- Requires 4 tables:
	- Job Table
	- Segment Map Table
	- Page Map Table
	- Memory Map Table
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211143748.png)
- Major disadvantages:
	- The overhead required for the extra tables;
	- The time required to reference the SMT and PMT.
- Associative memory is used to minimize the number of references and speed up the process.
- Associative memory is a set of registers allocated to each active job.
- The associative registers associate several segments and page numbers belonging to the job being processed with their main memory address.
	- Reside in main memory.
	- The number of registers varies between systems.
- When a job is allocated to the CPU:
	- Its SMT is loaded into main memory.
	- Its PMT is loaded as needed.
	- As pages are swapped btwn. main memory and secondary storage, all tables are updated.
- When a page is first requested:
	- The job’s SMT is searched to locate its PMT.
	- The PMT is loaded and searched to determine the page’s location in memory.
	- If the page is not in memory, a page interrupt is issued, the page is brought into memory, and the table is updated.
	- Since this segment’s PMT now resides in memory, another request for pages within this segment can be quickly accommodated.
- Accessing SMT and PMT is time-consuming.
- Associative memory overcomes this drawback by storing info about the most-recently-used pages in memory.
- When a page request is issued, two searches are initiated:
	- Through SMT and PMT;
	- Through the content of associative registers.
- If the search of the associative registers is successful:
	- the search through the tables are stopped;
	- address translation is performed using the info in the associative registers.
- Example:
	- A system with 8 associative registers per job will use them to store the SMT and PMT for the last eight pages referenced by that job.
	- When an address needs to be translated from segment and page numbers to a memory location, the system look first in the 8 associative registers.
	- If a match is found, the memory location is taken from the associative register.  Otherwise, the search in PMT and SMT continues. 

### Virtual Memory
- Virtual memory makes it possible to swap pages between main memory and secondary storage.
 - It gives users the impression that their entire program is loaded in main memory when only a portion of it is actually loaded.
- Prior to virtual memory, programmers are responsible for making sure programs fits into available memory.

- Segmentation allows users to share program code.
	- A shared segment contains:
	- An area where unchangeable code (reentrant code) is stored;
	- Several data areas, one for each user.
- Before virtual memory, sharing involves storing copies of files in each user’s account.
	- Users load their own copy and work on it at any time.
	- Creates a great deal of unnecessary cost – overhead of loading the copies and the extra secondary storage needed.
- Using virtual memory involves cooperation btwn:
	- Memory Mgr (tracks each page/segment), and 
	- Processor hardware (issues the interrupt and resolves the virtual address).
- Advantages of virtual memory mgmt:
	- A job’s size is not restricted to the size of main memory.
	- Memory is used more efficiently because only sections of a job that are immediately needed are stored in memory.
	- Allows an unlimited amount of multiprogramming.
- Advantages of virtual memory mgmt:
	- Eliminates external fragmentation and minimizes internal fragmentation by combining segmentation and paging.
	- Allows sharing of code and data.
	- Facilitates dynamic linking of program segments.
