	- Interconnected by communication links
		- Using cables, wireless technology, both
	- Common goal
		- Provide convenient resource sharing
		- Control access
	- General network configurations
		- Network operating system (NOS)
		- Distributed operating system (D/OS)
- Network operating system (NOS)
	- Networking capability
		- Added to single-user operating system
	- Users aware of specific computers and resources in network
	- Access resources
		- Log on to remote host
		- Data transfer from remote host

		- Communications cost
			- Time required to send message from one site to another
		- Reliability
			- Assurance of site communication if link or site fails
		- User environment
			- Critical parameters for successful business investment

### Star
- Transmitted data from sender to receiver
	- Passes through central controller
- Hub or centralized topology
- Advantages
	- Permits easy routing
	- Easy access control to network
- Disadvantages
	- Requires extremely reliable central site
	- Requires ability to handle all network traffic
		- No matter how heavy
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212022410.png)


 ### Ring
- Sites connected in closed loop
- May connect to other networks
	- Using bridge (same protocols)
	- Using gateway (different protocols)
- Data transmitted in packets
	- Source and destination address fields
- Packet passed from node to node
	- One direction only
- Every node must be functional
	- Bypass failed node needed for proper operation
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212103904.png)
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212103910.png)
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212103915.png)

### Bus
- Sites connect to single communication line
- Messages circulate in both directions
- One site sends messages at a time successfully
- Need control mechanism
	- Prevent collision
- Data passes directly from one device to another
	- Data may be routed to end point controller at end of the line
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212103947.png)

### Tree
- Collection of buses connected by branching cable
	- No closed loops
- Designers create networks using bridges
- Message from any site
	- Received by all other sites until reaching end point
- Reaches end point controller without acceptance
	- Host absorbs message
- Advantage
	- Message traffic still flows even if single node fails
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212104020.png)

### Hybrid

### Network Types
- Grouping
	- According to physical distances covered
- Characteristics blurring
- Network types
	- Local area networks (LAN)
		- Single office building, campus, similarly enclosed environment
			- Single organization owns/operates
		- Communicate through common communication line
		- Communications not limited to local area only
			- Component of larger communication network

	- Metropolitan area networks (MAN)
		- Configuration spanning area larger than LAN
			- Several blocks of buildings to entire city
				- Not exceeding 100 km circumference
		- Owned and operated by a single organization
			- Used by many individuals and organizations
			- May be owned and operated as public utilities
				- Means for internetworking several LANs
		- High-speed network often configured as a logical ring

	- Wide area networks (WAN) 
		- Interconnects communication facilities in different parts of a country or world
			- Operated as part of public utility
		- Uses common carriers’ communications lines
			- Telephone companies
		- Uses broad range of communication media
			- Satellite, microwaves
		- WANs generally slower than LANs
			- Examples: ARPAnet (first WAN), Internet (most widely recognized WAN)

		- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212104531.png)

### Software Design Issues
- How do sites use addresses to locate other sites?
- How are messages routed and how are they sent?
- How do processes communicate with each other?
- How are conflicting demands for resources resolved?

### Addressing Conventions
- Addressing protocols 
	- Fulfill need to uniquely identify users
	- Closely related to site network topology and geographic location
- Distinction between local and global name 
	- Local name within its own system
	- Global name outside its own system
		- Must follow standard name conventions (length, formats)
- Example: Internet address
	- someone@icarus.lis.pitt.edu
	- Uses Domain Name Service (DNS) protocol
		- General-purpose data query service
		- Hierarchical
- Domain names read left to right
	- Logical user to host machine
	- Host machine to net machine
	- Net machine to cluster
	- Cluster to network
- Periods separate components

### Routing Strategies
- Router
	- Internetworking device (primarily software driven)
	- Directs traffic 
		- Between two different types of LANs
		- Between two network segments (different protocol addresses)
	- Network layer operation
	- Role changes (network designs changes)
- Connects sites
	- To other sites and Internet
- Router functions
	- Securing information
		- Generated in predefined areas
	- Choosing fastest route 
		- From one point to another
	- Providing redundant network connections
- Routing protocol considerations
	- Addressing, address resolution, message format, error reporting
- Address resolution
	- Maps hardware address
- Message formats
	- Allow performance of protocol functions 
		- Finding new network nodes
		- Determine whether they work (testing)
		- Reporting error conditions
		- Exchanging routing information
		- Establishing connections (transmit data)
- Most widely used Internet routing protocols
	- Routing information protocol (RIP)
		- Path selection based on node and hop number
			- Between source and destination 
		- Path with smallest number of hops chosen (always)
		- Advantage
			- Easy to implement
		- Disadvantages
			- No consideration: bandwidth, data priority, network type
			- Update and reissue routing table: changes or not
			- Tables propagate (router to router)

	- Open shortest path first (OSPF)
		- Network state determined first
		- Transmission path selected
		- Update messages sent when changes in routing environment occur
			- Reduces number of messages in internetwork
			- Reduces message size: not sending entire table
		- Disadvantages
			- Increased memory usage
			- Bandwidth savings offset by higher CPU usage
			- Shortest path calculation


### Connection Methods
- Communication network concern
	- Moving data from one point to another
	- Minimizing transmission costs
	- Providing full connectivity
- `Circuit switching`
	- Dedicated communication path
		- Established between two hosts before transmission begins
	- Example: telephone system
	- Disadvantage
		- Delay before signal transfer begins
- `Packet switching`
	- Store-and-forward technique
		- Before sending message 
			- Divide into multiple equal-sized units (packets)
		- At destination
			- Packets reassembled into original long format
			- Header contains pertinent packet information
	- Advantages
		- More flexible, reliable 
		- Greater line efficiency
		- Users allocate message priority
	- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212105233.png)
	- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212105409.png)
- Datagrams
	- Packet destination and sequence number added to information
		- Uniquely identifying message to owning packet
	- Each packet handled independently
	- Route selected as each packet accepted 
	- At destination
		- All packets of same message reassembled
	- Advantages
		- Diminishes congestion and provides reliability
	- Message not delivered until all packets accounted for
	- Receiving node requests retransmission
		- Lost or damaged packets
	- Advantages
		- Diminishes congestion
		- Sends incoming packets through less heavily used paths
		- More reliability
		- Alternate paths set up upon node failure
- Virtual circuit
	- Complete path sender to receiver
		- Established before transmission starts
	- All message packets use same route
	- Several virtual circuits to any other node
	- Advantages
		- Routing decision made once
		- Speeds up transmission
	- Disadvantages 
		- All virtual circuits fail upon one failure
		- Difficult to resolve congestion (in heavy traffic)

### Conflict Resolution
- Device sharing requires access control methods
	- Facilitates equal and fair network access
- `Access control techniques`
	- Round robin
		- Node given certain time to complete transmission
		- Efficient
			- If many nodes transmitting over long time periods
		- Substantial overhead
			- If few nodes transmit over long time periods
		
	- Reservation 		
		- Good if lengthy and continuous traffic
		- Access time on medium divided into slots
		- Node reserves future time slots
		- Good configuration
			- Several terminals connected to host through single I/O port 


	- Contention
		- No attempt to determine transmission turn
		- Nodes compete for medium access 
		- Advantages and disadvantages
			- Easy implementation; works well under light to moderate traffic; better for short and intermittent traffic
			- Performance breaks down under heavy loads
- `Medium access control protocols`
	- Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)
		- Contention-based protocol 
		- Easy implementation (Ethernet)
		- Carrier sense
			- Node listens to/tests communication medium before transmitting messages
			- Prevents collision with node currently transmitting
		- Multiple access
			- Several nodes connected to same communication line as peers
			- Same level and equal privileges
		- CSMA Disadvantages
			- Collision
				- Two or more nodes transmit at same instant
			- Probability of collision increases 
				- As nodes get further apart 
			- Large or complex networks
				- Less appealing access protocol
		- CSMA/CD
			- Modification of CSMA
			- Includes collision detection (Ethernet)
			- Reduces wasted transmission capacity
			- Prevents multiple nodes from colliding 
				- Collisions not completely eliminated (reduced)
			- Collision occurrence involves small packet
		- No guarantee data will reach destination
		- Ensures error free data delivery
		- Use in Half-Duplex Communixation
		- New improved version: CSMA/CA (collision Avoidance)

	- Token passing
		- Special electronic message (token)
			- Generated and passed node to node
		- Only node with token allowed to transmit
			- Then passes token
		- Fast access
		- Collisions nonexistent
		- Typical topologies
			- Bus 
			- Ring
		- Token Bus
			- Token passed to node in turn
				- Data attached; sent to destination
			- Receiving node
				- Copies data; adds acknowledgment; returns packet to sending node
			- Sending node passes token to next node in sequence
			- Initial node order determination
				- Cooperative decentralized algorithm
				- Then determined by priority based on node activity
			- Higher overhead at each node (than CSMA/CD)
			- Nodes have long waits before receiving token
		- Token-ring
			- Token moves between nodes in turn
				- One direction only
			- To send message
				- Node must wait for free token 
			- Receiving node copies packet message
				- Sets copied bit indicating successful receipt


	- Distributed-queue, dual bus
		- Dual-bus configuration
			- Each bus transports data one direction only
			- Steady stream of fixed-size slots
		- Slots generated at end of each bus
			- Marked as free and sent downstream
				- Marked busy and written to nodes that are ready to transmit data
				- Written by nodes ready to transmit
			- Nodes read and copy data from slots
			- Continue travel toward end of bus: dissipate
		- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250212110337.png)
		- DQDB advantages
			- Negligible delays under light loads
			- Predictable queuing under heavy loads
			- Suitable for MANs managing large file transfers 
			- Satisfy interactive users’ needs
