# File Management

### Introduction 
- The File Mgr controls every file in the system.
- Its efficiency depends on:
	- how the file system is organized,
	- how they are stored,
	- how each file’s records are structured, and
	- how access to files is controlled
### The File Manager
- The File Mgr is responsible for creating, deleting, modifying and controlling access to files.
- Also responsible for managing resources used by files.
- Provide library support of programs and data to users.
- Collaborates with the Device Mgr.
- Performs 4 tasks:
	- Keep track of where each file is stored.
	- Use a policy that determines where and how files are stored, makes efficient use of available storage space and provide efficient access to files.
	- Allocate each file when a user has been granted access to it and record its use.
	- Deallocate the file when the file is to be returned to storage and communicate its availability to others waiting.
- The File Mgr keeps track of its files with directories that contain the filename, its physical location in secondary storage and other related info about the files.
- Uses a policy to determine who has access to a material.
- The OS must protect its files against system malfunctions and provide security checks via account numbers, passwords and lockwords to preserve integrity of data and safeguard against tampering.
- `Field`: a group of related bytes that can be identified by the user with a name, type and size.
- `File`: a group of related records that contains info to be used by specific application programs to generate reports.
- `Database`: appears to the File Mgr as a type of file but is more complex because it is a group of related fields that are interconnected at various levels.
- `Program files`: contains instructions.
- `Data files`: contains data.
- `Directories`: listings of filenames and their attributes and are treated in a manner similar to files by the File Mgr.

### Interacting with the File Mgr
- The user communicates with the File Mgr using specific commands:
	- embedded in the user’s program, or
	- submitted interactively by the user.
- File commands were designed to be simple so that you need not know the detailed instructions required to run the device where the file is stored, i.e. they are device independent.
- Each command is broken down into a sequence of low-level signals that trigger the step-by-step actions performed by the device.
- The READ command is decomposed:
	- Move the read/write head to the cylinder where the record is located.
	- Wait for the rotational delay until the sector passes under the read/write head.
	- Activate the appropriate read/write head and read the record.
	- Transfer the record to main memory.
	- Send a flag to indicate the device is free to satisfy another request.
- A secondary storage unit (e.g. disk, CD, USB device) is considered a `volume`.  
- Each volume can contain several files – `multifile volumes`.
- Each volume is given a name.
- The File Mgr writes the name and relevant info on an easy to access place on the unit (e.g. the first sector).
- Once the name is identified, the OS can interact with the storage unit.
- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212003701.png]]
- `The master file directory (MFD`) is stored immediately after the volume descriptor.
	- Lists the names and characteristics of every file contained in the volume.
	- File names may refer to program files, data files, system files.
- A semi-sophisticated File Mgr creates an MFD for a volume that can contain entries for both files and subdirectories.
- A subdirectory is created when a user open an account to access the computer system.
	- Its MFD is flagged to indicate that it is a subdirectory.
	- Its records are filenames pointing to files.

	- Its records are filenames pointing to files.
- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212015151.png]]
- Each file entry has a file descriptor:
	- Filename
	- File type
	- File size
	- File location
	- Date and time of creation
	- Owner
	- Protection info
	- Record size
- 2 components of a filename: 
	- A relative filename  is selected by users, e.g. assignment1, projectOS, legolas.
	- An extension is 2-3 characters long and is separated from the relative name by a period, e.g. .doc, .xls, .htm.

### File Organization
- File organization is concerned with the arrangement of records within a file.
- When a user modifies the content of a file, he is actually accessing the records within a file.
- Record Format
	- A file is composed of records.
	- Within a file, records have the same format.
		- May be of fixed or variable length.
		- May be blocked or not blocked.
	- Fixed-length records are the most common because they are the easiest to access.
		- Critical factor is the record size.
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212015718.png]]
	- Variable-length records don’t leave empty storage space and do not truncate any characters.
	- Disadvantage: difficult to access directly because it is hard to calculate exactly where the record is located.
- Physical File Organization
	- Physical organization is concerned with:
		- how records are arranged, and 
		- the characteristics of the medium used to store it.
	- On magnetic disks, files are organized as either sequential, direct, or indexed sequential.
	- Which is the best file organisation? Consider:
		- Volatility of data,
		- Activity of the file,
		- Size of file,
		- Response time.
	- `Sequential record organisation` is the easiest to implement.
		- Optimization feature: select a key field from the record and sort records by the key.
		- Drawback: complicates the maintenance algorithm because the original order must be preserved each time a record is added or deleted.
	- `Direct record organisation` uses direct access files and can only be implemented on DASDs.
	- Flexibility of accessing a record in any order – do not have to begin a search from the beginning of the file.
	- A record is identified by its relative address.
		- Is an address relative to the beginning of a file.
		- Is a logical address that is calculated when the record is stored.
	- How is the logical address calculated?
		- A record is has a unique key field.
		- A hashing algorithm is used to transform the key into a number that is used as the record’s logical address.
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212015951.png]]
	- `Indexed sequential record organisation` combines sequential and direct access.
	- Is maintained through an Indexed Sequential Method (ISAM) software.
	- Does not use a hashing algorithm.
	- Generates an index file that is used to retrieve records.
	- An ordered sequential file is divided into blocks of equal size.
	- To access a record in a file:
		- System searches the index file (acts as a pointer to the data file).
		- Go to the physical location indicated at that entry.


### Physical Storage Organisation
- The File Mgr works with files as whole units.
- Also as logical units / records.
- Records within a file must have the same format but may vary in length.
- Records are sub-divided into fields – structure is managed by application programs.
- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020100.png]]
- Contiguous Storage
	- Contiguous storage means records are stored one after another.
	- Simple to implement and manage.
	- A record can be found and read once its starting address and size are known.
	- Advantage: ease of direct access.
	- Disadvantage: a file cannot be expanded unless there is empty space available immediately following it.
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020131.png]]
- Non-contiguous Storage
	- Non-contiguous storage allows files to use any storage space available on the disk.
	- Records are stored contiguously only if there is enough empty space.
	- Remaining records are stored in other sections of the disk.
		- An `extent` refers to any remaining records stored in other sections.
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020239.png]]
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020243.png]]
- Indexed Storage
	- Indexed storage allows direct record access by combining an index block with pointers that link every extent of that file.
	- Each file has its own index block consisting of the addresses of each disk sector that make up the file.
	- The index lists each entry in the same order the sectors are linked.
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020311.png]]

### Access Methods
- Access methods are determined by file organisation.
- 2 types of access methods:
	- Sequential access,
	- Direct access.
- The `current byte address (CBA)` is the last byte read. 
	- Is used by the File Mgr to access records.
	- Must be updated each time a record is accessed.
- Sequential Access
	- For fixed-length records, the CBA is updated by incrementing it by the record length (RL).
		- CBA = CBA + RL
	- For variable-length records, CBA is updated by adding the length of the record ($RL_k$) and the number of bytes used to hold the record length (N).
		- CBA = CBA + N + $RL_k$
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020511.png]]
- Direct Access
	- For fixed-length records, the CBA is computed directly from the record length and the desired record number (RN).
		- CBA = (RN - 1) * RL
	- For variable-length records, the File Mgr has to do a sequential search through the records.
		- Cannot access a record directly because the address is difficult to compute.
	- The File Mgr could save the address of the last record accessed and when the next request arrives it searches forward from the CBA if the address is between the CBA and the end of file.
	- Indexed sequential file can be accessed sequentially or directly.
	- Either approach to calculate CBA can be used.
		- Extra step: the index file must be searched for the pointer to the block where data is stored.
		- Index file is small and is kept in main memory.

### Levels in a File Mgmt System
- The higher positioned module passes info to the lower modules so that they can perform the required service and continue the communication down the chain to the lowest module.
	- The highest module is the `Basic File System`; it passes info the `Access Control Module` and so on.
- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020642.png]]
- Each module is further divided into more specific tasks.
- Example:
	- READ RECORD NUMBER 7 FROM FILE CLASSES INTO STUDENT
		- CLASSES is the name of a direct access file opened for input.
		- STUDENT is the record previously defined within the program.
- The info is used by the basic file system to activate the access control verification module.
	- If the user is allowed access, info and control are passed to the logical file system.
	- Otherwise, an “access denied” message is sent to the user.
- The logical file system uses the record number to obtain CBA.
	- CBA = (RN - 1) * RL
- The result of the computation plus other info is passed to the physical file system.
	- It computes the physical location (block number) where the record is stored.
	- The info is passed to the device interface module.
- The device interface module transforms the block number to the actual cylinder/ surface/record combination to retrieve info from the disk.
- Once the info is retrieved, control returns to the physical file system, which copies the info into the desired memory location.
- When the operation is complete, an “all clear” message is passed to all other modules.

### Access Verification Model
- Modern OS supports file sharing.
- One of the concerns that arises from file sharing is safeguarding the integrity of each file.
	- Need control over who is allowed to access a file.
	- What type of access is permitted.
- 5 actions on a file: READ, WRITE, EXECUTE, DELETE, or any combination of the four.
- Access Control Matrix
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020830.png]]
- Access Control Lists
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020840.png]]
- Capability Lists
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250212020934.png]]
- The fourth scheme is `lockword`.
- Is similar to a password but protects a single file (a password protects a system).
- When you create a file, you can protect it by giving it a `lockword`.
- Advantage: requires the smallest amount of storage for file protection.

### Data Compression
- Is a technique to save space in files.
- 3 methods.
- Records with repeated characters can be abbreviated.
	- Data in a fixed-length field may contain many blank character, e.g. ADAMbbbbbb is encoded as ADAMb6.
	- Numbers with trailing zeros can be shortened, e.g. 3000000 is encoded as 3#6.
- `Repeated terms` can be compressed by using symbols to represent most commonly used words in the database.
	- Common words in a university database, such as course, student, grade etc., can be represented using a single character.
- `Front end compression` is used in DB mgmt systems for index compression.
