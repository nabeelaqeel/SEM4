# Introduction

### What is an operating system?
- It is THE boss of a computing system.
- An operating system (OS) is the executive manager of a computing system that manages all hardware and software.
- It controls every file, device, section of main memory and nano-second of processing.

### OS Software
- There are 4 managers of an OS:
	- Memory manager
	- Processor manager
		- Job scheduler
		- Process scheduler
	- Device manager
	- File manager
 - Each  manager must work harmoniously with other managers.

### Sub-system managers

### Main Memory Management
- The Memory Manager is in charge of main memory (RAM).
- Checks the validity of each request for memory space – allocates, reallocates and deallocates.
- Key features of RAM chips? ROM?

### Processor Management
- The Processor Manager decides how to allocate the CPU.
- Keep track of the status of each job, process, threads etc.
- Monitor the CPU while handling each process’s transition. Like traffic controller.
- Multiple CPU?

### Device Management
- Responsible for connecting with every device that’s available on the system.
- Choosing the most efficient way to allocate each of these printers, ports, disk drives, and more based on device scheduling policies.
- Example?

### File Management
- Keeps track of every file in the system including data files, program files, utilities, compilers, applications etc.
- Enforces restrictions on file access control.

### Network Management
- Only for OS with networking capability.
- Provides convenient way for authorized users to share resources.
- This manager must take overall responsibility for every aspect of network connectivity, including the requirements of the available devices as well as files, memory space, CPU capacity, transmission connections & types of encryption (if necessary).

### User Interface
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Command line interface

## An Evolution of Computing Hardware

### History of OS Development
-  1st-generation computers (1940-1955).
- 2nd-generation computers (1955-1965).
- 3rd-generation computers (from mid 1960s).
- 1970s.
- 1980s.
- 1990s.
- 2000s.
- 2010s

### The First Computers
- Augusta Ada Byron, the world’s first computer programmer played a key role in formulating the notion of programming the Analytical Engine.

- In 1991, the London Science Museum built the Difference Engine using Babbage's plans, as shown in this woodcut. It worked perfectly.

- Hollerith & the Automated Census Bureau
	- invented an electronic punching device
	- founded Tabulating Machine Co. which became IBM

> Hollerith’s punched-card tabulating machines are the predecessors of today’s business machines.

### Foundations of Modern Computing
- ENIAC, created by Dr. John Mauchly & J. Presper Eckert, for use in the war but was not completed in time.  It was mainly used to solve math problems.

### The Stored Program Concept
- The computer program, as well as the data, is stored in the computer’s memory.

### The First Generation (1950s)
- The first generation of computers used vacuum tubes. Vacuum tubes failed frequently so first generation computers did not work most of the time.

- Eckert and Mauchly delivered the first UNIVAC to the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951. UNIVAC gained fame when it predicted Eisenhower as the winner of the 1952 U.S. presidential election.

### The First Generation
- Features of UNIVAC
	- easier to use (than ENIAC)
	- fewer vacuum tubes (more reliable)
	- stored program
	- general-purpose
	- used machine language
- IBM 701 
- IBM 650

###  Second Generation (Early1960s)
- The transistor heralded the second generation of computers
- Features and Advancements 
	- still used punch cards
	- used printers, tape storage, & disk storage
	- used high-level programming languages
	- COBOL & FORTRAN introduced
- IBM 1401 
- Electronic Recording Machine -- Accounting (ERMA)
- American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)
- IBM System/360
	- line of compatible computers
	- instruction set enabled to be used for both business and science

### The Third Generation (Mid 1960s to Mid 1970s)
- Advancements and Milestones
	- used timesharing
	- accessed remotely by terminals
	- used integrated circuits (small, medium, to large-scale integration) resulting in lower cost
- More Advancements and Milestones
	- DEC’s minicomputer, the PDP-8
	- many different programming languages
	- IBM “unbundled” its systems
- Still More Advancements and Milestones
	- Wide-area networks (WAN) developed
	- ARPANET implemented Internet protocols (TCPIP)
	- Local area networks (LAN) developed
	- Mainframes (proprietary)/minicomputers (open architecture)

### The Fourth Generation (1975-1991)
- Advancements and Milestones
	- employed very-large-scale integration (VLSI)
	- developed Intel 4004, first microprocessor
	- Apple Computer founded 
	- IBM introduced the Personal Computer (PC)
	- IBM compatibles or clones introduced
- The first IBM PC was released in 1981. Intel provided the microprocessor chip and Microsoft Corporation provided the operating system
- The first GUI was developed at Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)
- Microsoft’s Windows 98 is a popular GUI designed for IBM-compatible microcomputers
- Macintosh was the first commercial personal computer to offer a user interface

### A Fifth Generation?
- Experts have forecast that the hallmark of the fifth generation will be artificial intelligence (AI), in which computers exhibit characteristics of human intelligence. AI has been slow in coming.
- Technologically, we’re still in the fourth generation, in which engineers are pushing to see how many transistors they can pack on chip. This effort alone will bring some of the trappings of AI.

### Types of Operating Systems
- 4 categories based on response time and how data is entered into the system:
	- Batch systems,
	- Interactive systems,
	- Real-time systems, and
	- Hybrid systems.

### Hardware Configuration

### Machine Hardware
- A computer’s hardware is the physical machine and its electronic components.
- `Main memory`: where data and instructions must reside to be processed.
- `Input/output (I/O) device`: peripheral units such as printers, disk drives, CD drives, thumb drive.
- `Central processing unit (CPU)`: the brain of a computer. 
	- Controls the operation of the entire computer system.
	- Consists of circuits (chips) to control the interpretation and execution of instruction.

### Current OS
- The features of current OS are based on users’ needs.
	- Support for multimedia applications
	- Internet and Web access
	- Client/server computing
- The system architecture has been improved in the way components are programmed and organized.
- Use of object-oriented design; reorganization of the kernel.
- The `kernel` is the part of the OS that resides in memory at all times.
- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250210230132.png]]
- Another important improvement is the introduction of `threads`.
- A process has 2 characteristics:
	- It requires space in main memory where it resides during the execution.  From time to time, it requires other resources (e.g. data files).
	- It passes through several states (e.g. running, waiting, ready) from its initial arrival to its completion.
- In a modern OS, processes are swapped between main memory and secondary storage during execution.
	- In conventional processes (known as heavyweight processes), this incurs high overhead because for each swap, all process info must be saved to preserve the process’s integrity.
- A `thread` is a unit smaller than a process; it can be scheduled and executed.
	- The heavyweight process which owns resources becomes a passive element.
	- The thread becomes the element that uses the CPU and is scheduled for execution.
	- Swapping a thread is less time consuming than swapping a process because there is less info to be saved.
- `Multiprocessing` is where two or more CPUs share the same main memory, most I/O devices and the same control program routines.  They service the same job stream and execute distinct processing programs concurrently.
- `Symmetric multiprocessing` allows several CPUs to process multiple jobs at the same time.
	- The CPUs are independent of each other.
	- Each CPU has access to the OS.
	- They share memory and secondary storage devices.
	- ![[../images/Pasted image 20250210230345.png]]
- In `asymmetric multiprocessing`, some OS functions are assigned to subordinate processors, which take their instructions from the main CPU.
	- E.g. in a system with one processor, all disk scheduling and program calculations are managed by the CPU.
	- If a second CPU is added and assigned the responsibility for disk scheduling, then upon request from the main CPU this processor executes its own algorithm to handle requests for disk access.
- `Network Manager` – an additional management task for network. Today, in most OS, they incorporate Network Manager to coordinate the workings of the networked resources, which might include shared access to memory space, processors, printers, databases, monitors and applications.
- `Cloud Computing` – it changes the role of OS. It allows OS to accommodate remote access to system resources, and provides increased security for these transactions. However, at its roots, the OS still maintains responsibility for managing all local resources and coordinating data transfer to and from the cloud.
