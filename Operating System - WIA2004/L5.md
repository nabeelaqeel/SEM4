# Process Management

### Analogy 
- The staircase at a building was built as a fire escape route but people in the building often take the stairs instead of the slow lift.
- The stairs is only wide enough for one person.
- Traffic flows smoothly unless there are two people moving in opposite directions.
- There is a landing between each floor that is wide enough for people to share.
- A problem occurs when someone going up the stairs meets someone coming down and each refuse to retreat to the landing, thus, creating a deadlock.
- Another possibility: a few patient people wait on the landing for a break in the opposing traffic, and the break never comes, they could wait forever – starvation.

### Introduction
- A lack of process synchronization may lead to:
	- `Deadlock`: a situation where the resources needed by a job to finish execution are held by another job, which in turn, is waiting for other resources to become available.  Also termed `deadly embrace.`
	- `Starvation`: the result of conservative allocation of resources in which a job is prevented from executing because it is kept waiting for resources that never become available.

### Deadlock 
- A deadlock affects more than one job.
- Example of deadlock: traffic jam.
- Only outside intervention can resolve a deadlock.
- Deadlocks are prevalent in interactive systems because the system is more flexible than a batch environment.
- Interactive systems improve the use of resources through dynamic sharing but this also increases the possibility of deadlocks.
- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211211954.png)
- Usually occurs when non-sharable, non-preemptable resources (e.g. files, printers) are allocated to jobs that eventually require other non-sharable, non-preemptive resources that have been locked by other jobs.
- 7 cases of deadlocks:
	- Deadlocks on file requests;
		- Occurs when jobs are allowed to request and hold files for the duration of their execution.
		- Example: a home construction company has two depts – purchasing (P1) and sales (P2).  Both depts need access to two files – inventory (F1) and suppliers (F2) – to update daily transaction.
		- A deadlock occurs when the following sequence of events take place:
			- Purchasing (P1) accesses the supplier file (F2) to place an order for more lumber.
			- Sales (P2) accesses the inventory file (F1) to reserve the parts that will be required to build the house ordered that day.
			- P1 doesn’t release F2 but requests F1 to verify the quantity of lumber on hand before placing on order but P1 is blocked because F1 is held by P2.
			- P2 doesn’t release F1 but requests for F2 to check the subcontractor’s schedule --> DEADLOCK.

	- Deadlocks in databases;
		- Occurs if two processes access and lock records in a database.
		- Locking is a technique used to guarantee data integrity by locking out other users while working with the database.
		- Locking can be done at 3 levels:
			- Lock the entire DB for the duration of the request;
			- Lock a subsection of the DB;
			- Lock individual record.
		- Locking increases the possibility of deadlocks.
		- Example: a system locks a record when it is accessed until the process is complete.  Two processes (P1 and P2) need to update two records (R1 and R2). 
		- The following sequence lead to a deadlock.
			- P1 accesses R1 and locks it.
			- P2 accesses R2 and locks  it.
			- P1 requests R2, which is locked by P2.
			- P2 requests for R1, which is locked by P1.
		- `Alternative`: do not use locks but this may lead to integrity problem.
			- The updated records might include only some of the data – this is known as a race.

		- 
	- Deadlocks in dedicated device allocation;
		- Two users run 2 programs, P1 and P2, and both programs need two tape drives to copy files from one tape to another.
		- The following sequence leads to deadlocks:
			- P1 requests tape drive 1 and gets it.
			- P2 requests tape drive2 and gets it.
			- P1 requests tape drive 2 but is blocked.
			- P2 requests tape drive 1 but is blocked.
		- Neither job can continue because each is waiting for the other to finish.

	- Deadlocks in multiple device allocation;
		-  Occurs when several processes request and hold on to dedicated devices while other processes act similarly.
		- None of the jobs can continue because each is waiting for a resource held by another.
		- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211212455.png)
		
	- Deadlocks in spooling;
		-  Although a printer is a dedicated device, it can be transformed into a sharable device by installing a disk between it and the CPU.
		- The disk accepts output from several users and acts as a temporary storage area for all output until the printer is ready to accept it – this is known as spooling.
		- If the printer needs all of a job’s output before it begins printing but the spooling system fills the available disk space with only partially completed output, a deadlock occurs.
		- Scenario
			- One hour before an important project deadline, members of your team are frantically finishing the details.
			- A few minutes before the deadline, all  team members issue the print command.
			- The spooler received the pages one at a time but the pages are received separately – page 1s, page 2s and so on.
			- The printer is ready to print the first completed document, but as the spooler canvasses its files it has the first page for several documents but none of the complete document.
			- Since the printer only accepts completed files, none of the documents can be printed.

	- Deadlocks in disk sharing.
		- Disks are designed to be shared – not uncommon for two processes to access different areas of a disk.
		- This ability to share creates an active type of deadlock termed `livelock`.
		- Processes use a form of busy waiting that is different from a natural wait – it is waiting to share a resource but never gains control of it.

- Conditions for Deadlock
	- All 6 deadlocks involve the interaction of several processes and resources.
	- Each deadlock is preceded by the simultaneous occurrence of 4 conditions that the OS could recognize:
		- Mutual exclusion;
		- Resource holding;
		- No preemption;
		- Circular wait.	

### Modelling Deadlocks
- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211212946.png)
- Assume a system has three processes - P1, P2, P3, and three resource – R1 (printer), R2 (disk drive), R3 (plotter).
- Scenario 1

| Events | Action                                         |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | P1 requests and is allocated the printer (R1). |
| 2      | P1 releases R1.                                |
| 3      | P2 requests and is allocated the disk (R2).    |
| 4      | P2 releases R2.                                |
| 5      | P3 requests and is allocated the plotter (R3). |
| 6      | P3 releases R3.                                |

- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211213041.png)
-   There are no cycles in the directed graph.
 -  Conclusion: a deadlock can’t occur even if each process requests every resource if the resources are released before the next process requests them.
- Scenario 2

| Events | Action                           |
| ------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1      | P1 requests and is allocated R1. |
| 2      | P2 requests and is allocated R2. |
| 3      | P3 requests and is allocated R3. |
| 4      | P1 requests R2.                  |
| 5      | P2 requests R3.                  |
| 6      | P3 requests R1.                  |

- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211213128.png)
- There is a deadlock because every process is waiting for a resource held by another process, but none will be released without operator intervention.

- Scenario 3

| Event | Action                                    |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1     | P1 requests and is allocated R1.          |
| 2     | P1 requests and is allocated R2.          |
| 3     | P2 requests R1.                           |
| 4     | P3 requests and is allocated R3.          |
| 5     | P1 releases R1, which is allocated to P2. |
| 6     | P3 requests R2.                           |
| 7     | P1 releases R2, which is allocated to P3. |

- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211213214.png)
- The graph can be expanded to include several resources of the same type that can be allocated individually or in groups to the same process.
- Devices of the same type are clustered into one entity.
- The arrows show the links between a single resource and the process using it.

### Strategies for Handling Deadlocks
- Requests and releases are unpredictable and that makes it difficult to design a foolproof preventive policy.
- 3 strategies to deal with deadlocks:
	- `Prevention`: prevent one of the four conditions from occurring;
		- The OS must eliminate one of the four necessary conditions to prevent a deadlock – complicated.
		- Mutual exclusion is necessary because certain resources must be exclusively allocated to one user at a time.
		- Resource holding can be avoided by forcing each job to request every resource it will need to run to completion when it starts executing.
		- No preemption could be bypassed by allowing the OS to deallocate resources from jobs.
		- Circular wait can be bypassed if the OS prevents the formation of a circle.
		- Solution is based on a numbering system for resources: e.g. printer = 1, disk = 2,  tape =3, plotter = 4.
		- A job must request for its resources in ascending order.


	- `Avoidance`: avoid the deadlock if it becomes probable;
		- The OS can avoid a deadlock if it knows in advance the sequence of requests associated with each active process.
		- The Banker’s Algorithm proposed by Dijkstra regulates resource allocation to avoid deadlocks.  
		- The algo is based on a bank with a fixed amount of capital that operates on the following principles:
			- No customer will be granted a loan exceeding the bank’s total capital.
			- All customers will be given a maximum credit limit when opening an account.
			- No customer will be allowed to borrow over the limit.
			- The sum of all loans won’t exceed the bank’s total capital.
		- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211213641.png)
		- Total loaned: 6,000
		- Total capital fund: 10,000
		- The bank in in a safe state.
		- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211213714.png)
		- Total loaned: 9,000
		- Total capital fund: 10,000
		- The bank in in a unsafe state.
		- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211213741.png)
		- Total number of devices allocated: 6
		- Total number of devices in the system: 10
		- This is a safe state – 6 devices are allocated; 4 are still available.
		- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211213819.png)
		- Total number of devices allocated: 9
		- Total number of devices in the system: 10
		- This is an unsafe state – 9 devices are allocated; only 1 is still available.
		- The OS must be sure never to satisfy a request that moves it from a safe state to an unsafe state.
		- When a request is received, the OS must identify the job with the smallest number of remaining resources and make sure that the number of available resources is at least equal to the number needed for this job to run to completion.
		- The Banker’s Algo is not always practical because:
			- As a job enters the system, it must predict the max number of resources it needs – not practical for interactive systems.
			- The number of total resources must remain constant.  If a device breaks, the algo won’t work.
			- The number of jobs must remain fixed – not possible in interactive systems.
			- The overhead cost of running the avoidance algo can be quite high when there are many active jobs and many devices because it has to be invoked for each request.
			- Resources are not well utilised because the algo assumes the worst case, hence, keeps vital resources unavailable to avoid unsafe states.
			- Scheduling suffers due to poor utilization and jobs are kept waiting for resource allocation.  May lead to indefinite postponement of a more complex jobs requiring many resources.

	- `Detection`: detect the deadlock when it occurs and recover from it gracefully.
		- Deadlocks can be detected by building directed resource graphs and looking for cycles.
		- The detection algo can be executed when appropriate, e.g. every hour, once a day, when there is noticeable throughput degradation.
		- The detection algo “reduces” a directed graph.
		- Steps to reduce a graph:
			1. Find a process that is currently using a resource and not waiting for one.  Remove the process from the graph by disconnect-ing the link tying the resource to the process.  The resource is returned to the “available list”.
			2. Find a process that is waiting for resource classes that are not fully allocated.  This process does not contribute to deadlock since it will eventually get the resource it is waiting for, finishes and return the resource to the available list.
			3. Go back to step 1 and continue with Steps 1 and 2 until all lines connecting resources to processes have been removed.

			- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211214212.png)
		- If there are any lines left, this indicates that the request of the process cannot be satisfied and that a deadlock exists.
		- The following graph shows a deadlock situation.
		- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211214242.png)
		

### Recovery
- Once a deadlock is detected, it must be untangled and the system returned to normal as soon as possible.
- Recovery algorithms require at least one victim (an expendable job).
- Removing the victim  from the deadlock will free the system.
- The job that becomes a victim has to be restarted from the beginning or from a convenient mid point.
- Method 1: the simplest and most drastic approach is to terminate all active jobs and restart them.
- Method 2: terminate only jobs involved in a deadlock and ask their users to resubmit them.
- Method 3: identify jobs involved in a deadlock and terminate them one at a time, checking to see if the deadlock is eliminated after each removal.
- Method 4: can only be used of the job keeps a record (snapshot) of its progress so it can be interrupted and then continued without restarting from the beginning. 
	- The snapshot is like the landing in the staircase – instead of forcing a acscender/descender to return to the bottom of the staircase, he only retreats to the nearest landing and wait for others to pass.
- Method 5: selects a non-deadlocked job, preempts the resources it is holding, and allocates them to a deadlocked process so it can resume execution, thus breaking the deadlock.
- Method 6: stops new jobs from entering the system to allow non-deadlocked jobs to get the resources they need to run to completion. 
 - Factors to consider when selecting a victim with least negative effect on the system:
	- Priority of job – high-priority jobs are usually untouched.
	- CPU time used by job – jobs close to completion are left alone.
	- The number of other jobs that would be affected if this job were selected as the victim.

### Starvation 
- Starvation is the result of conservative allocation of resources where a single job is prevented from execution because it is kept waiting for resources that never become available.
- “The Dining Philosophers” problem introduced by Dijkstra.
- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211214550.png)
- In a computer environment, the resources are like forks and the competing processes are like dining philosophers.
- If the resource mgr does not watch for starving processes and jobs, and plan for their completion, they could remain in the system forever.
- Once a system is detected, the system can block new jobs until the jobs have been satisfied.
