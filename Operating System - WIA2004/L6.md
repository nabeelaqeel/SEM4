# Concurrent Processes

### Analogy 
- You drive to KFC drive-through window.
- When you place your order, the order clerk confirms your request, tells you how much it costs and ask you to drive to the pick-up window.
- At the pick-up window, the cashier collects your money and hands over your order.
- This is a synchronised multiprocessing system.
- You come into contact with 2 processors – the order clerk and the cashier.
- There are at least 2 more processors to make the system work – the cook and the bagger.
- Compare the scenario to an information retrieval system.
	- Processor 1 (order clerk) accepts the query, checks for errors, and passes the request to Processor 2 (bagger).
	- Processor 2 searches the database for the required info (hot & spicy chickens).
	- Processor 3 (cook) retrieves data from the database (chicken to cook) if it’s kept offline in secondary storage.  Once data is gathered (chicken is cooked), it is placed where Processor 2 can get it (in the chicken bin).
	- Processor 2 passes it to Processor 4 (cashier).
	- Processor 4 routes the response (your order) back to the originator of the request (you).

### What is Parallel Processing?
- Parallel processing or multiprocessing is a situation in which two or more processors operate in unison.
	- >= 2 processors execute instruction simultaneously.
- The Processor Mgr has to coordinate the activity of each processor and synchronise the interaction among the CPUs.
- Synchronisation is a key factor in the success of multiprogramming systems.
- A system will only work properly if every processor communicates and cooperates with every other processor.
- 2 major reasons behind multiprocessing:
	- Enhance throughput;
	- Increase computing power.
- 2 benefits: increased `reliability` and `faster processing`.
- The benefits are achieved by careful design.
	- The failing processor can inform other processor(s) to take over;
	- The OS can restructure its resource allocation strategies so that remaining processors don’t become overload.
- A few ways to allocate the CPU:
	- Allocate a CPU to each job;
	- Allocate a CPU to each working set;
	- Subdivide individual instructions and each subdivision is processed simultaneously.
 - Increased flexibility brings increased complexity.  2 challenges:
	 - How to connect the CPUs into configurations;
	 - How to orchestrate their interaction.

### Typical Multiprocessing Configurations
- Master/slave configuration
	- Is an asymmetric multiprocessing system.
	- Is a single-processor system with additional slave processors, each is managed by the primary master processor.
	- The master processor is responsible for managing the entire system.
	- Suitable for an environment where the processing time is divided btwn front-end and back-end processors.
	- ![](../images/Pasted%20image%2020250211223648.png)
	- Advantage: simple.
- Disadvantages:
	- The reliability is not much better than a single processor system.
	- Can lead to poor utilization of resources.
	- Increased number of interrupts.

- Loosely coupled configuration
	- Several complete computer systems, each with its own memory, I/O devices, CPU and OS.
	- Loosely coupled because each processor controls its own resources.
	- Each processor can communicate and cooperate with the others.
	- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211223749.png)
	- When a job arrives:
		- It is allocated to one processor.
		- It remains with the same processor until it finishes.
	- The job scheduling algo keeps the system well-balanced and ensures the best use of resources using several requirements and policies.
		- E.g. new jobs are assigned to the processor with the lightest load.

- Symmetric configuration
	- Is best implemented if all processors are of the same type.
	- Advantages over loosely coupled config:
		- More reliable;
		- Uses resources effectively;
		- Can balance loads well;
		- Can degrade gracefully in the event of failure.
	- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211224057.png)
	- Is the most difficult config to implement because processes must be well synchronised to avoid races and deadlocks.
	- Process scheduling is decentralised.
	- There is one copy of the OS.
	- Each processor has access to a global table listing each process and its status that is stored in a common area of the memory.
	- Processors use the same scheduling algo.
	- When a process is interrupted, its processor updates the corresponding entry in the process list and finds another process to run.
	- Since each processor has access to all I/O devices and can reference any storage unit, there are more conflicts when several processors try to access the same resources – requires algo to resolve conflicts.

### Process Synchronization Software
- Process synchronization depends on the capability of the OS to make a resource unavailable to other processes while it is being used by one of them.
- A used resource is locked from other resources until it is released – only then can a waiting process be allowed to use the resource.
- Synchronization is important because a mistake could leave a job waiting indefinitely or lead to a deadlock.
- Example: Processor 1 and Processor 2 finish their job executions at the same time.  To run the next job, each processor must:
	- Consult the list of jobs to see which one should run next.
	- Retrieve the job for execution.
	- Increment the READY list to the next job.
	- Execute it.
- Other resources where the same problem can occur: memory and page allocation tables, I/O tables, application databases, any shared resources.
- A synchronization mechanism is required to provide cooperation and communication among processes.
	- Allows a process to finish work on a critical region of a program before other processes have access to it. 
- A `critical region` is a part of a program that must complete execution before other processes can have access to the resources being used.
- Synchronization can be implemented using a `lock-and-key` scheme.
	- A process checks to see if a key is available.
	- If it is available, the process picks it up and put it in the lock to make the resource unavailable to other processes.
- There are several locking mechanisms:
	- Test-and-Set
		- Is an indivisible machine instruction known as TS.
		- It tests to see if the key is available.  If it is, it sets it to unavailable.
		- The key is a single bit in a storage location whose value is 0 if it is free; 1 if it is busy.
		- TS has one parameter (the storage location) and returns one value (busy/free).  It takes only one machine cycle.
		- Process 1 (P1) tests the condition code using the TS instruction before entering a critical region.
			- If no other process is in the critical region, P1 is allowed to proceed and the condition code is changed from 0 to 1.
			- When P1 exits the critical region, the condition code is reset to 0 so another process can enter.
			- If P1 finds a busy condition code, it is placed in a waiting loop where it continues to test the condition code and waits until it is free.
		- Test-and-Set is simple to implement and works well for a small number of processes.
		- 2 drawbacks:
			- When many processes are waiting to enter a critical region, starvation could occur because processes gain access in an arbitrary fashion.
			- Waiting processes remain in unproductive, resource-consuming wait loops, known as `busy waiting`.

	- WAIT and SIGNAL
		- Is a modification of Test-and-Set to remove busy waiting.
		- Consists of 2 operations that are mutually exclusive: WAIT and SIGNAL.
		- WAIT is activated when the process encounters a busy condition code.
			- It sets the process’s PCB to a blocked state and links it to the queue of processes waiting to enter the critical region.
			- The Process Scheduler selects another process for execution.
		- SIGNAL: is activated when a process exits the critical regions and the condition code is set to free.
			- It checks the queue for processes waiting to enter the critical region, selects one and sets it state to READY.
			- Eventually, the Process Scheduler will choose this process for running.
	- Semaphores
		- Is a flag that has a non-negative integer value.
		- Analogy: flag-like signaling used by railroads to indicate whether the track is clear.
		- In an OS, a semaphore signals if and when a resource is free and can be used by a process.
