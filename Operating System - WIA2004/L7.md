# Device Management

### Introduction 
- A Device Mgr manages every peripheral device in the system.
- Maintains a balance between a finite supply of devices with the users’ indefinite demand for them.
- Involves 4 basic functions:
	- Tracks the status of each device.
	- Uses preset policies to determine which processes get a device and for how long.
	- Allocates the devices.
	- Deallocates the devices.

### Types of Devices
- 3 categories of devices:
	- Dedicated devices, e.g. printers, tape drives, plotters.
	- Shared devices, e.g. disk, direct access storage device.
	- Virtual devices

### Sequential Access Storage Media
- Magnetic tapes was among the early storage media.
- Used for routine archiving and storing backup data.
- Records are stored serially; a record may be of any length.
- Each record is determined by its position on the tape.
- To access a record, the tape must be mounted and fast-forwarded from the beginning until the desired position is located. 
- Time consuming – up to minutes.
- Assume a reel of tape is ½ inch wide and 2400 feet long.
- The number of characters that can be recorded per inch is determined by the tape density, e.g. 1600 bytes/inch (bpi).
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211225055.png)
- Records may be stored individually or in blocks.
- A magnetic tape moves under the read/ write head when there is a need to access a record.
- A tape moves in jerks: read/write a record and stop, read/write a record and stop.
- The tape needs time and space to stop, so a gap is inserted between each record.
- The gap is called an `interrecord gap (IRG)` and is about ½ inch long.
- Assuming that a record is 1/10 inch long, and we need to store 10 records, 5½ inches of tape is required to store one inch of data – inefficient use of the storage medium.
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211225141.png)
- Alternatively, records are grouped into blocks (blocking) before recording them on tape.
- The number of records in a block is determined by the application – set to take advantage of the transfer rate.
	- transfer rate = density * transport speed
- Transport speed is measured in inches/sec (ips).
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211225219.png)
- IBG = interblock gap
- 2 advantages of blocking:
	- Fewer I/O operations are needed because one READ command can move an entire block containing several logical records into main memory.
	- Less tape is wasted because the size of physical record exceeds the size of the gap.
- 2 disadvantages of blocking:
	- Overhead and software routines are needed for blocking, de-blocking and record keeping.
	- Buffer space is wasted if you need only one logical record but must read the entire block to retrieve it.
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211225344.png)
- Access time varies widely.
	- Magnetic tape is a poor medium for routine secondary storage except for files with very high sequential activity.
- Advantages of magnetic tape.
	- Low cost.
	- Compact storage capabilities.
	 - A good medium for backing up magnetic disks and for long-term archive storage.

### Direct Access Storage Devices
- A DASD is a device that can directly read/write to a specific place on a disk.
- Also termed `random access`.
- Classified into 4 categories:
	- Magnetic disks;
	- Optical disks;
	- Flash memory;
	- Magneto-optical disks.

### Fixed-Head Magnetic Disk Storage
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211225657.png)
- The fixed-head disk is very fast.
- Disadvantages:
	- High cost.
	- Reduced storage space compared to movable-head disk because the tracks must be positioned farther apart to accommodate the width of the read/write heads.

### Movable-Head Magnetic Disk Storage
- Has one read/write head that floats over the surface of each disk.
- Disks can be a single platter or part of a disk pack (a stack of magnetic platters).
- Each platter has two surfaces for recording.
- Each surface is formatted with a specific number of concentric tracks where the data is recorded.
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211225822.png)
- To access a record, the system needs to know its:
	- Cylinder number, 
	- Surface number,
	- Record number.

### Optical Disc Storage
- Optical storage devices are called discs to differentiate  them from magnetic storage disks.
- A difference between an optical disc and a magnetic disk is the track and sector design.
- 2 measures of optical disk drive performance: 
	- sustained data-transfer rate (MBps),
	- average access time (milliseconds).
- Another important feature that affects performance is cache size.
- A hardware cache acts as a buffer by transferring blocks of data from the disc. 
	- Anticipates that the user may want to reread some recently retrieved information.
	- Data can be read more quickly if the information is in the cache.
	- Also act as a read-ahead buffer.
- Types of optical discs system:
	- Compact Disc (CD) , e.g. CD-ROM, CD-Recordable, CD-Rewritable.
	- Digital Versatile Disc (DVD)
	- Magneto-optical disks

### DASD Access Time
- 3 factors determine access time:
	- seek time,
	- search time (rotational delay),
	- transfer time.
### DASD Access Time: Fixed-head Devices
- Fixed-head devices access a record based on its track number and record number.
- The total amount of time required to access data depends on:
	- Rotational speed,
	- Position of the record relative to the position of the read/write head.
	- total access time = $\frac{Rotational Delay + Data Transfer Time}{Access Time}$
	- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211230243.png)
	- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211230300.png)
- The small variance in access makes DASD suitable for:
	- Files with low activity,
	- Applications that access records in a random fashion.
- Record blocking may be done to save time.

### DASD Access Time: Movable-head Devices
- The total amount of time required to access data depends on:
	- Rotational speed,
	- Position of the record relative to the position of the read/write head,
	- Seek time.
	- total access time = $\frac{Rotational Delay + Data Transfer Time + Seek Time}{Access Time}$

### Components of the I/O Subsystem 
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211230848.png)
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211230904.png)
- I/O channels synchronize the fast speed of the CPU with the slow speed of the I/O device.
- Overlaps I/O operations with processor operations so the CPU and I/O can process concurrently.
- I/O channel programs are used to specify the action to be performed by devices and controls the data transmission data between main memory and the control units.
- The I/O control unit interprets the signal, e.g. “rewind” for a tape drive.
- In most systems, one control unit is attached to several similar devices.
- At the start of an I/O command, the info passed from the CPU to the channel is:
	- I/O command, e.g. READ, WRITE, REWIND.
	- Channel number, 
	- Address of the physical record to be transferred,
	- Starting address of a memory buffer from/into which the record is to be transferred.
- Channels are as fast as the CPU and can direct several control units by interleaving commands.
- Each control unit direct several devices.

### Communication among Devices
- The Device Mgr needs to resolve 3 problems:
	- It needs to know which components are free/busy.
	- It must be able to accommodate requests that arrive during heavy I/O traffic.
	- It must accommodate the speed disparity between the CPU and the I/O devices.
- Each unit in the I/O subsystem can finish its operation independently of each other.
- The system needs to know when a device completes an operation.
- Achieved using a hardware flag called `Channel Status Word (CSW)`.
	- Consists of 3 bits in main memory.
	- Indicate the status of the channel.
- 2 ways to perform the test: 
	- `Polling`: CPU periodically tests the channel status bit in CSW.
	- `Interrupt`: a hardware mechanism does the test as part of every machine instruction executed by the CPU.
- `Direct Memory Access (DMA)` allows a control unit to directly access main memory.
- Once reading/writing has begun, the remainder of the data can be transferred to/from memory without CPU intervention.
- `Buffers` are used to better synchronize the movement of data between the relatively slow I/O device and the fast CPU.
- Buffers are temporary storage areas residing at three locations: main memory, channels and control unit.
- Are used to store data :
	- read from an input device before it is needed by the processor, and
	- that will be written to an output device.
- Double buffering is used to maximize throughput.
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211231405.png)

### Management of I/O Requests
- The Device Mgr handles an I/O request as 3 tasks, each handled by a specific software component.
	- `I/O Traffic Controller`: watches the status of all devices, control units, and channels.
	- `I/O Scheduler`: implements the policy that determine the allocation of, and access to, the devices, control units and channels.
	- `I/O Device Handler`: performs the actual data transfer and processes device interrupts.
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211231710.png)

### Device Handler Seek Strategies
- A `seek strategy` for the I/O device handler is a pre-determined policy that the handler uses to allocate access to the device among many processes that are waiting for it.
- It determines the order in which processes get the device.
- Goal: keep the seek time to a minimum.
- Common strategies: FCFS, shortest seek time first (SSTF), SCAN.
- A scheduling algo should:
	- Minimize arm movement;
	- Minimize mean response time;
	- Minimize the variance in response time.
- FCFS
	- Simple, easy to program and fair to users.
	- Example: a single sided disk with one recordable surface where tracks are numbered from 0 to 49.
	- Assume it takes 1 ms to travel from one track to an adjacent track.
	- While retrieving data from Track 15, requests arrive for Tracks 4, 40, 11, 35, 7 and 14.
	- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211231952.png)
- SSTF 
	- Concept similar to SJN.
	- The request with the track closest to the one being served is the next to be satisfied – minimize overall seek time.
	- Disadvantage: it favours easy-to-reach requests and postpone travelling to those that are out of the way.
	- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211232125.png)
- SCAN
	- SCAN uses a directional bit to indicate whether the arm is moving toward the centre of the disk or away from it.
	- It moves the arm from the outer to the inner track, servicing every request in its path.
	- When it reaches the innermost track, it reverses direction and moves toward the outer tracks, servicing every request in its path.
	- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211232426.png)
	- Variations of SCAN:
		- LOOK
		- N-Step SCAN
		- C-SCAN
		- C-LOOK
- Which strategy is best?
	- FCFS is suitable for light load.  Service time becomes unacceptably high as load increases.
	- SSTF is suitable for moderate loads. Localisation problem under heavy loads.
	- SCAN is suitable for light to moderate loads and eliminates indefinite postponement.
	- C-SCAN is suitable for moderate to heavy loads.  Very small variance in service time.

### Search Strategies: Rotational Ordering
- `Rotational ordering` is a search strategy that tries to optimise search time by ordering requests once the read/write head has been positioned.
- Example: assume the cylinder has 5 tracks.  Each track contains 5 sectors.
	- Requests are taken in the order they arrive.
	- Each request is satisfied as it comes in.

### RAID
- Redundant Array of Independent Disks.
- Is a set of physical disk drives that is viewed as one logical unit by the OS.
- Assumes that several smaller-capacity disk drives are preferable because by distributing data among several smaller disks, the system can simultaneously access the requested data from multiple drives.
	- Improves I/O performance.
	- Improves data recovery in case of a failure.
- A typical configuration may consist of 5 hard disks connected to a specialised controller.
- A software that coordinates data transfer from the disk resides in the controller.
- Data is divided into segments called `strips` that are distributed across the disks in the array.
	- A set of strips is called a `stripe`.
	- The process is called `striping`.
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211232742.png)
- ![](../res/Pasted%20image%2020250211232746.png)
- Level 0
	- No error correction.
	- No redundancy.
	- Cannot recover from hardware failure.
	- Suitable for transferring non-critical data.
- Level 1
	- Uses striping.
	- Provides redundancy by having a duplicate set of all data in a mirror array of disks that acts as backup in case of hardware failure.
	- A read request can be satisfied from the main array or the mirrored array.
	- Disadvantage: requires twice as much effort because data must be written twice.
- Level 2
	- Uses very small strips.
	- Hamming code for error detection and correction.
	- Is an expensive and complex config to implement.
- Level 3
	- Is a modification of Level 2 that needs only one disk for redundancy.
	- Only one parity bit is computed for each strip and it is stored in the designated redundant disk.
- Level 4
	- Uses the same strip scheme in Levels 0 and 1 but computes a parity for each strip, then stores the parities in the designated parity disk.
	- Advantage: if one drive fails, data can be restored using bits in the parity disk.
- Level 5
	- Is a modification of Level 4.
	- The parity strips is distributed across the disk to avoid the bottleneck created in Level 4.
- Level 6
	- Provides an extra degree of error detection and correction because it requires two different parity calculations.
	- Both parities are distributed on separate disks across the array and are stored in the strip that corresponds to the data strips.
