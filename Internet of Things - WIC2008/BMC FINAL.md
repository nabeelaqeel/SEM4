## ✅ **Key Topics Breakdown + Predicted Exam Questions + Suggested Answers**

---

### 🧩 1. **Security Measures in IoT (especially BMC context)**

#### 🔥 Possible Exam Question:

> “What do you think about the current security measures in IoT systems used in BMC (Building Management Control)? As an engineer, what would you implement to enhance security?”

#### ✅ Model Answer:

IoT systems in BMC are often vulnerable due to poor encryption, default passwords, and open ports. These risks can lead to unauthorized access to HVAC systems, lighting, and access control.

**As an engineer**, I would implement:

- **End-to-End Encryption (TLS/SSL)** for data transmission.
    
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for access control.
    
- **Network segmentation** to isolate IoT devices from the main corporate network.
    
- **Firmware auto-updates** to patch vulnerabilities.
    
- **Device identity management** using unique device certificates or MAC binding.
    
- **Monitoring tools** like intrusion detection systems (IDS) for anomaly detection.
    

This ensures that building systems like HVAC, lighting, elevators, and access controls are secure from tampering or misuse.

### 🧩 2. **Wireless Attendance Tracker in BMC**

#### 🔥 Possible Exam Question:

> “Design a wireless attendance tracking system suitable for a building management scenario. What technology will you use, and how will it work?”

#### ✅ Model Answer:

A **wireless attendance tracker** can be implemented using:

- **RFID/NFC cards** or **Bluetooth (BLE) beacons**.
    
- **Raspberry Pi/ESP32** as IoT edge devices with scanners.
    
- **Wi-Fi or MQTT over Wi-Fi** to send data to a ThingsBoard dashboard or cloud.
    
- **Backend integration** with a database for tracking and analytics.
    

**How it works**:

1. Each employee carries an RFID/Bluetooth tag.
    
2. At entry points, Raspberry Pi detects the signal (using RFID module or BLE scanner).
    
3. The Pi logs time + user ID and sends it to the cloud.
    
4. Data is stored and shown on a dashboard (e.g., ThingsBoard, Node-RED).
    

**Advantages**:

- Touchless system (good post-COVID).
    
- Real-time data.
    
- Can integrate with room lighting and HVAC (if someone is present, system activates).

### 🧩 3. **Cost to Implement the Wireless Attendance Tracker**

#### 🔥 Possible Exam Question:

> “Estimate the cost of implementing a wireless attendance tracking system for a small office with 10 employees.”

#### ✅ Model Answer:

|Component|Unit Cost (MYR)|Qty|Total (MYR)|
|---|---|---|---|
|RFID Tags / BLE Beacons|RM10|10|RM100|
|RFID Reader / BLE Scanner|RM40|1|RM40|
|Raspberry Pi / ESP32|RM100|1|RM100|
