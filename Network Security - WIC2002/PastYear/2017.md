**Question 1: Cryptographic Methods**

**a) Briefly explain the terms cryptology, cryptography, and cryptanalysis.**  
(3 marks)
- **Cryptology**: The overarching science of secure communication, encompassing both cryptography (creating secure systems) and cryptanalysis (breaking such systems).    
- **Cryptography**: Techniques for encrypting plaintext into ciphertext to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (e.g., AES, RSA).
- **Cryptanalysis**: The study of analyzing and breaking cryptographic systems to uncover weaknesses (e.g., brute-force attacks on weak keys).
    

**b) Explain authentication, integrity, and confidentiality with protocol/algorithm examples.**  (6 marks)

1. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of communicating parties.
    - **Example**: TLS/SSL uses digital certificates (X.509) and protocols like EAP for authentication.
        
2. **Integrity**: Ensuring data is unaltered during transit.
    - **Example**: SHA-256 hashing or HMAC in IPsec ensures data integrity.
        
3. **Confidentiality**: Preventing unauthorized access to data.
    - **Example**: AES (symmetric) or RSA (asymmetric) encrypts data.
        
**c) Integrity in ancient vs. modern times.**  (6 marks)

- **Ancient**: Seals (wax/stamps) on physical documents ensured tamper evidence (e.g., Roman signet rings).
- **Modern**:
    1. **Sender** hashes the message (e.g., SHA-3) and encrypts the hash with their private key (digital signature)
    2. **Receiver** decrypts the signature with the sender’s public key, recomputes the hash, and compares it to verify integrity and origin (e.g., PGP/GPG).

**a) White hat, black hat, and grey hat hackers.**  
(3 marks)
- **White Hat**: Ethical hackers who test systems for vulnerabilities (e.g., penetration testers).
- **Black Hat**: Malicious hackers exploiting systems for personal gain (e.g., ransomware attacks).
- **Grey Hat**: Hackers who violate laws but without malicious intent (e.g., exposing vulnerabilities publicly without permission).


**b) Traits of effective network security professionals.**  (4 marks)

1. **Proactive Learning**: Staying updated with threats (e.g., zero-day exploits).
2. **Analytical Skills**: Using tools like Wireshark or SIEM for threat detection.
3. **Ethical Mindset**: Adhering to frameworks like NIST or ISO 27001.
4. **Adaptability**: Implementing defense-in-depth (firewalls, IDS/IPS).
    

**c) DoS vs. DDoS attacks (with Figure 1).**  (8 marks)

- **DoS**: Single source floods a target (e.g., SYN flood) overwhelming its resources.
- **DDoS**: Multiple compromised devices (botnet) attack simultaneously (e.g., Mirai botnet).
- **Figure 1 Explanation**:
    - DoS: Attacker → Target Server.
    - DDoS: Attacker → Botnet (Zombie PCs) → Target Server.

 **a) Login/password on console/vty/aux: Pros and cons.**  (3 marks)
- **Pros**: Simple to implement; no extra infrastructure.
- **Cons**: Weak to brute-force; no encryption (plaintext passwords vulnerable).
    

**b) SSH vs. Telnet security.**  (3 marks)

- **SSH**: Encrypts all traffic (AES), uses public-key auth, and stores keys in a local database (`authorized_keys`).
- **Telnet**: Transmits data in plaintext (sniffable); no encryption.
    
**c) Local vs. server-based AAA.**  (4 marks)

- **Local AAA**: Used in small networks (e.g., router-local usernames).
- **Server-based (e.g., RADIUS/TACACS+)**: Centralized auth for large networks.  
    **Steps**:
    1. User sends credentials to NAS (Network Access Server).
    2. NAS forwards to RADIUS server.
    3. Server checks credentials and grants/denies access.

**a) Substitution cipher for "NETWORK SECURITY".**  (3 marks)

- **Cipher**: Shift each letter by +3 (A→D, B→E).
- **Plaintext**: N E T W O R K S E C U R I T Y
- **Ciphertext**: Q H W Z R U N V H F X U L W B
    
**b) Symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption.**  
(4 marks)

- **Symmetric**: Single key (e.g., AES).
    - **Advantage**: Faster encryption.
    - **Disadvantage**: Key distribution problem.
- **Asymmetric**: Key pairs (e.g., RSA).
    

**c) Sending a symmetric key via public-private keys.**  (3 marks)

1. **Alice** sends her **public key** to Bob.
2. **Bob** encrypts the symmetric key (e.g., AES key) with Alice’s public key.
3. **Alice** decrypts it with her **private key** to obtain the symmetric key.
