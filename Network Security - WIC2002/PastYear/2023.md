- **Firewall**: Acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks, filtering traffic based on predefined rules (e.g., blocking ports/IPs). It operates at Layers 3–4 (Network/Transport).
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity/alerts administrators (e.g., Snort). It is passive and reactive.
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**: Actively blocks detected threats in real-time (e.g., Cisco Firepower). It is proactive and inline with traffic.

**Contrasts**:
- Firewalls control access; IDS/IPS detect/prevent attacks.
- IDS alerts only; IPS takes action.
- Firewalls use rules; IDS/IPS use signatures/anomaly detection.

```
[Internet] → [Firewall] → [Switch] → [IPS] → [Servers]  
                             ↓  
                      [IDS (Monitoring)]  
                             ↓  
                      [End-User Devices]  
```

- **Firewall** filters inbound/outbound traffic.
- **IPS** inspects and blocks malicious traffic.
- **IDS** monitors internal traffic for anomalies.

**a) ARP on Same LAN (3 marks)**
1. Host A broadcasts ARP request: "Who has IP X?"
2. Host B (with IP X) replies with its MAC address.  
3. Host A updates ARP cache.

```
[A] -- ARP Request (Broadcast) --> [All Hosts]  
[B] -- ARP Reply (Unicast) --> [A]  
```

**(b) ARP on Different LAN (3 marks)**

1. Host A sends ARP for gateway/router MAC.
2. Router forwards traffic to the external LAN.

```
[A] -- ARP for Gateway --> [Router]  
[Router] -- ARP for Dest --> [External LAN]  
```

**(c) ARP Spoofing/Poisoning (4 marks)**

- **Method**: Attacker sends fake ARP replies, associating their MAC with a legitimate IP (e.g., gateway).
- **Impact**: Traffic is redirected to the attacker (MITM).
- **Example**:  
    Attacker sends: "IP Gateway = Attacker’s MAC". Victims cache this, sending data to the attacker

**(a) VPN Purpose (4 marks)**

- **Definition**: Encrypted tunnel over public networks for secure remote access/site connectivity.
    
- **Why Use?**:
    1. Confidentiality (encryption).
    2. Integrity (tamper-proof data).
    3. Access control (authentication).
    4. Bypass geo-restrictions.

**b) Site-to-Site VPN Setup (6 marks)**  
**Steps**:

1. **Configure Routers**: Enable VPN services (e.g., IPsec).
2. **Authentication**: Set pre-shared keys/certificates.
3. **Encryption**: Choose protocols (AES, IKEv2).
4. **Tunnel Setup**: Define local/remote subnets.
5. **Test Connectivity**: Ping between sites.

**(b) HMAC Protection (4 marks)**

- **Attacks Prevented**: Message tampering, replay attacks.
- **Process**:
    1. Sender: `HMAC = Hash(Message + Secret Key)`.
    2. Receiver: Recomputes HMAC; verifies match.

```
[Sender] -- Message + HMAC --> [Receiver]  
Receiver compares HMACs for integrity.  
```

**Steps to Educate Staff**:

1. **Regular Workshops** (2.5 marks):
    - Conduct sessions on phishing, password hygiene.
    - Use real-world examples (e.g., mock phishing tests).
        
2. **Security Policies** (2.5 marks):
    
    - Document clear rules (e.g., BYOD, data handling).
    - Ensure staff acknowledge policies.
        
3. **Simulated Attacks** (2.5 marks):
    
    - Run drills (e.g., ransomware scenarios).
    - Debrief to improve responses.
        
4. **Role-Based Training** (2.5 marks):
    
    - Tailor content (e.g., finance teams on fraud).
    - Assign responsibilities (e.g., reporting incidents).
