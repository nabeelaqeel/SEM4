a) Securing administrative access to routers and switches (6 marks)

i) **Strong passwords**:
- Passwords should be at least 12 characters long containing uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters
- Use complex passphrases instead of simple words (e.g., "NetworkSecurity@UM2023!" instead of "admin123")
- Implement password aging policies forcing regular changes (e.g., every 90 days)
- Store passwords using strong hashing algorithms (SHA-256 or better)
- Enable password encryption service on network devices (e.g., "service password-encryption" in Cisco IOS)
    

ii) **Line access**:

- Restrict administrative access to specific console, AUX or VTY lines
- Implement access control lists (ACLs) to limit which IP addresses can access management interfaces
- Use SSH instead of Telnet for remote line access (VTY lines)
- Configure exec-timeout to automatically disconnect idle sessions
- Example configuration:

```
line vty 0 4
     access-class 10 in
     transport input ssh
     exec-timeout 5 0
     login local
```
    

iii) **Virtual logins**:

- Implement AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) using TACACS+ or RADIUS servers
- Create local user accounts with privilege levels and enable password protection
- Configure login banners to display legal notices
- Enable logging of login attempts for auditing purposes
- Example configuration:
    
```
aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local
username admin privilege 15 secret StrongPass123
```

b) Administrative access control (6 marks)

i) **Privilege levels method**:
- Cisco IOS devices have 16 privilege levels (0-15) where level 15 is full access
- Commands can be assigned to specific privilege levels
- Users are granted access to commands based on their privilege level
- Example configuration:

```
privilege exec level 5 show running-config
privilege exec level 10 configure terminal
username operator privilege 5 secret OperatorPass
```
    

ii) **Three limitations of privilege levels**:

1. Limited granularity - only 16 levels available which may not be sufficient for complex organizations
2. No role separation - users at same level have identical access rights
3. Difficult to manage at scale - requires manual configuration on each device
    

iii) **Role-based CLI Access**:

- More granular than privilege levels with named roles containing specific command permissions
- Uses the "parser view" concept in Cisco IOS
- Views can be customized to show only authorized commands
- Example configuration:
```
parser view NETWORK-OPERATOR
 secret OperatorPass123
 commands exec include show
 commands exec include ping
username operator view NETWORK-OPERATOR secret OperatorPass
```

A zero-day attack exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware for which no patch or fix is available. The term "zero-day" refers to the fact that developers have had zero days to address and fix the vulnerability since it became known. These attacks are particularly dangerous because:

1. There are no existing signatures or patterns for detection systems to recognize
2. No vendor-supplied patches are available
3. Attackers can maintain access until the vulnerability is discovered and patched
4. Often used in targeted attacks against high-value system

b) Approaches to prevent/minimize network attacks (6 marks)

1. **Defense in Depth**:
    - Implement multiple layers of security controls (firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection)
    - Use network segmentation to limit lateral movement
    - Apply principle of least privilege for all access
        
2. **Patch Management**:
    
    - Regular vulnerability scanning and timely patching
    - Automated patch deployment systems
    - Critical patch emergency deployment procedures
        
3. **Network Monitoring**:
    
    - Implement SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems
    - Use NetFlow/sFlow for traffic analysis
    - Deploy IDS/IPS systems with regularly updated signatures
        
4. **Access Control**:
    
    - Strong authentication (MFA, certificate-based)
    - Network Access Control (NAC) solutions
    - Role-based access control (RBAC)
        
5. **Encryption**:
    
    - Implement TLS for all network communications
    - Use IPsec for site-to-site VPNs
    - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
        
6. **Security Awareness**:
    
    - Regular staff training on security best practices
    - Phishing simulation exercises
    - Clear security policies and procedures
        

c) Host-based vs Network-based systems (6 marks)

**Host-based systems (HIDS/HIPS)**:  

_Advantages_:
1. Can monitor system-specific activities (file changes, registry modifications)
2. Provides visibility into encrypted traffic after decryption
3. Can detect attacks that don't traverse the network (local exploits)
4. Less affected by network architecture changes
5. Can enforce policies at endpoint level
    
_Disadvantages_:
1. Requires installation and maintenance on each host
2. Consumes host resources (CPU, memory)
3. Limited visibility into network-wide threats
4. Vulnerable to compromise if host is breached
5. Difficult to manage at scale
    

**Network-based systems (NIDS/NIPS)**:  
_Advantages_:

1. Single point of monitoring for network traffic
2. Can detect widespread scanning or worm activity
3. Doesn't consume endpoint resources
4. Can protect legacy systems that can't run host agents
5. Can analyze traffic patterns across multiple hosts
    
_Disadvantages_:

6. Blind to encrypted traffic contents
7. May be bypassed through alternate network paths
8. Can generate false positives from normal traffic
9. Requires careful placement in network topology
10. May become bottleneck in high-speed networks

a) Data confidentiality (2 marks)

The purpose of data confidentiality is to ensure that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals and protected from unauthorized disclosure. This is achieved through:

1. Encryption algorithms (AES, RSA, ECC) to transform readable data into unreadable ciphertext
2. Access control mechanisms (RBAC, MAC, DAC) to restrict data access
3. Secure transmission protocols (TLS, IPsec, SSH)
4. Data masking and tokenization techniques
5. Proper key management practices

b) Cipher and transposition method (3 marks)

A cipher is a mathematical algorithm used to perform encryption and decryption of data. It consists of two main components: the algorithm (set of rules) and the key (secret value). Ciphers can be symmetric (same key for encryption/decryption) or asymmetric (different keys).

**Transposition cipher method**:
- Rearranges the positions of plaintext characters according to a system
- Does not alter the actual characters, only their order
- Example: Rail Fence cipher
    - Plaintext: "NETWORK SECURITY"
    - Write in zigzag pattern:
    
```
N . . . O . . . E . . . R . . .
. E . W . R . S . C . I . I . Y
. . T . . . K . . . U . . . T
```
- Ciphertext by reading rows: "NOER EWRSCIIY TKUT"

a) VPN definition (2 marks)

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network (typically the Internet). It extends a private network across a public network by encapsulating and encrypting data packets within standard Internet Protocol packets. VPNs provide:

1. Secure remote access to network resources
2. Encryption of data in transit
3. Authentication of communicating parties
4. Tunneled communication through untrusted networks
5. Often uses protocols like IPsec, SSL/TLS, L2TP, or PPTP
    

b) VPN purposes and benefits (2 marks)

**Purposes**:
1. Secure remote access for mobile workers
2. Connect geographically separated offices (site-to-site)
3. Bypass geographic restrictions (when permitted by policy)
4. Secure communication over public WiFi
5. Hide actual network topology
    
**Benefits**:
6. Cost savings compared to leased lines
7. Flexibility in connectivity options
8. Strong encryption protects data confidentiality
9. Authentication prevents unauthorized access
10. Can provide integrity checking of transmitted data
    

c) VPN types with diagrams (4 marks)

**1. Remote-access VPN**:

```
[Remote User] ← Internet → [VPN Gateway] ↔ [Corporate Network]

```

- Used by individual users connecting to corporate network
- Typically uses SSL/TLS or IPsec
- Client software required on user device
- Authenticates individual users
- Examples: Cisco AnyConnect, OpenVPN
    

**2. Site-to-site VPN**:

```
[Branch Office] ← Internet → [VPN Gateway] ↔ [Corporate Network]
                     ↑
[Another Branch] ←───┘
```


- Connects entire networks together
- Typically uses IPsec or MPLS
- Router-to-router connection
- Authenticates devices/gateways
- Can be intranet (within organization) or extranet (between organizations)
    

d) Authentication using PSK and RSA (6 marks)

**PSK (Pre-Shared Key) Authentication**:

```
[Client]                          [Server]
   |                                  |
   |--- PSK (pre-shared secret) ----->|
   |<-- PSK (pre-shared secret) ------|
   |                                  |
   |-- Encrypted Session Established->|
```

- Both parties share same secret key beforehand
- Simple to implement but less secure
- Vulnerable to brute force attacks if weak key used
- Used in IPsec (IKEv1) and some WiFi (WPA-PSK)

**RSA Authentication**:


```
[Client]                          [Server]
   |                                  |
   |<----- Server's Public Key --------|
   |                                  |
   |-- Encrypted Challenge (w/PubKey)->|
   |                                  |
   |<--- Decrypted Challenge Response--|
   |                                  |
   |-- Encrypted Session Established->|
```

- Uses asymmetric cryptography
- Server has private key, client has public key
- More secure than PSK
- Supports perfect forward secrecy
- Used in SSL/TLS, IKEv2

**Comparison Diagram**:

```
PSK Authentication:
[Client] --- Shared Secret ---> [Server]
           (Same key both ends)

RSA Authentication:
[Client] --- Public Key ------> [Server]
           (Different keys)
[Client] <-- Encrypted Data --- [Server]
           (Using private key)
```
