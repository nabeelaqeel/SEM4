**a) Three examples of organizational data that should be protected:**

1. **Employee/Customer Personal Data**    
    - Examples: Social security numbers, credit card details, medical records.
    - _Rationale_: Breaches can lead to identity theft, legal penalties (e.g., GDPR), and reputational damage.
2. **Intellectual Property (IP)**
    - Examples: Patent blueprints, proprietary software code, trade secrets.
    - _Rationale_: Unauthorized access could result in financial losses or competitive disadvantage.
3. **Financial Records**
    - Examples: Bank account details, transaction logs, tax filings.
    - _Rationale_: Critical for operational integrity; tampering may cause fraud or regulatory violations.

**(b) Reconnaissance Attack**

- **Definition**: A preliminary attack where hackers gather information about a target network to identify vulnerabilities (e.g., open ports, system architecture).
    
- **Execution Methods**:
    
    - **Port Scanning**: Tools like Nmap scan for active services.
    - **DNS Interrogation**: Querying DNS records to map network resources.
    - **Social Engineering**: Phishing emails to extract insider information.
        
- _Impact_: Enables follow-up attacks like DDoS or SQL injection.
    

**(c) Hacking Titles Explained**

1. **Script Kiddies**
    - Unskilled hackers who use pre-written scripts/tools (e.g., Metasploit) without understanding the underlying mechanisms.
    - _Motivation_: Often seek notoriety or mischief.
        
2. **Hacktivists**
    - Activists who hack to promote political/social agendas (e.g., Anonymous).
    - _Methods_: Defacing websites, leaking sensitive data.

**a) Traditional vs. Modern Endpoint Security**

|**Aspect**|**Traditional**|**Modern**|
|---|---|---|
|**Protection Scope**|Signature-based antivirus|AI/ML-driven threat detection|
|**Updates**|Manual patches|Real-time, automated updates (e.g., EDR)|
|**Visibility**|Limited to known threats|Behavioral analysis (e.g., Zero Trust)|

- _Key Shift_: Modern security focuses on proactive measures like endpoint detection and response (EDR).
    
**(b) Importance of Layer 2 Protection**

- **Why Critical?**
    - Layer 2 (Data Link) handles MAC addressing/switching; breaches here bypass higher-layer defenses.
    - Attacks like ARP spoofing or VLAN hopping can intercept traffic.
- **Example**: A compromised switch can redirect traffic to a malicious host.
    

**(c) STP Attack Mitigation**

- **Attack Diagram**:
```
Attacker → Spoofs Root Bridge BPDUs → Topology Reconfigured → Man-in-the-Middle  
```
    
- **Countermeasures**:
    1. **Root Guard**: Blocks unauthorized root bridge claims.
    2. **BPDU Guard**: Disables ports receiving BPDUs (for edge ports).
    3. **PortFast**: Skips STP listening/learning states on non-trunk ports.
    4. **Loop Guard**: Prevents alternate ports from becoming designated.
        
- **Explanation of Root Guard**:
    - Configured on designated ports to reject superior BPDUs, ensuring the legitimate root bridge retains control.

**(a) CAN Topology Diagram**

```
[Internet] → [Router] → [Firewall] → [IPS/IDS] → [Layer 3 Switch] → [Layer 2 Switch] → [Servers/Hosts]  
                     ↑                              ↑  
                  [ESA/MSA]                   [AAA/DHCP Servers]  
```

**(b) Device Security Tasks**

1. **Router**:
    - Implement ACLs to filter inbound/outbound traffic.
    - Enable VPN for secure remote access.
        
2. **Firewall**:
    - Enforce stateful inspection to block unauthorized connections.
        
3. **IPS/IDS**:
    - Monitor traffic for anomalies (e.g., Snort for signature-based detection).
        
4. **Layer 3 Switch**:
    - Use VLANs to segment traffic; apply routing security (e.g., DHCP snooping).
        
5. **Layer 2 Switch**:
    - Enable STP protections (BPDU Guard) and disable unused ports.
        
6. **AAA Server**:
    - Authenticate users via RADIUS/TACACS+; log access attempts.
        
7. **ESA/MSA**:
    - Scan emails for malware (e.g., Cisco ESA for spam filtering).

# Q4
![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020250706145355.png)**(a) AAA Explained**

- **Authentication**: Verifies user identity (e.g., passwords, biometrics).
- **Authorization**: Grants permissions (e.g., role-based access control).
- **Accounting**: Logs user activities for auditing (e.g., session duration).
- _Example_: A RADIUS server authenticates a remote worker, authorizes access to HR files, and logs login times.
    

**(b) Data Integrity**

- **Definition**: Ensuring data is unaltered during transmission/storage.
- **Achievement Methods**:
    - **Hashing**: SHA-256 checksums detect tampering.
    - **Digital Signatures**: PKI validates sender authenticity (e.g., TLS certificates).
    - **Protocols**: TCP checksums and HTTPS encryption.
