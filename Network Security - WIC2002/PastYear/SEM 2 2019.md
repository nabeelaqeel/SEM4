a) FOUR possible vectors of data loss:

1. **Phishing attacks** where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive data.  
2. **Insider threats** where employees intentionally or accidentally leak data.
3. **Malware infections** that steal or corrupt data.
4. **Unsecured cloud storage** leading to unauthorized access.
    

(b) Importance of securing a network for an organization:

Securing a network prevents financial losses, protects customer trust, and ensures compliance with data protection laws.

 (c) Examples of perimeter security:

- **Outside perimeter security:** Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS).
- **Inside perimeter security:** Access control lists (ACLs), endpoint security software.

 (d) Explanation of hacker titles:

- **Vulnerability Brokers:** Hackers who discover and sell security flaws to organizations or governments.
- **Hacktivist:** Hackers who breach systems for political or social causes.
    
 (e) Malware and its importance:

Malware is malicious software designed to harm systems. Knowing about it helps in prevention and mitigation of cyber threats

Router Hardening Aspects:
1. **Disabling unused services** (e.g., Telnet, HTTP).
2. **Implementing strong passwords** and encryption.
3. **Enabling logging and monitoring** for suspicious activities.
4. **Applying firmware updates** to patch vulnerabilities.
5. **Configuring access control lists (ACLs)** to restrict unauthorized access

 (a) Cryptology, Cryptography, and Cryptanalysis:

- **Cryptology:** Study of secure communication techniques.
- **Cryptography:** Practice of encryption/decryption.
- **Cryptanalysis:** Study of breaking cryptographic systems.  
    **Purpose of cryptography:** Ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data.

 (c) Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption:

- **Symmetric:** Uses one key (faster but less secure key distribution).
- **Asymmetric:** Uses public/private keys (secure key exchange but slower).
    

d) FOUR Network Security Measures:

1. **Firewalls** to block unauthorized traffic.
2. **Encryption** to protect data in transit.
3. **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for secure access.
4. **Regular security audits** to identify vulnerabilities.

(a) VPN Diagram Explanation:

A VPN creates a secure tunnel over a public network, encrypting data between a user and a private network.

(b) Security in VPNs:

Achieved through **encryption (e.g., AES)** and **tunneling protocols (e.g., IPsec, SSL/TLS)**.

c) FOUR VPN Benefits:

1. **Secure remote access** via encrypted connections.
2. **Bypassing geo-restrictions** by masking IP addresses.
3. **Cost savings** by reducing dedicated leased lines    
4. **Anonymity** by hiding user identity.
    

d) Remote-Access vs. Site-to-Site VPN:

- **Remote-Access:** Connects individual users to a network (e.g., employees working remotely).    
- **Site-to-Site:** Connects entire networks (e.g., branch offices).
    

(e) IPsec VPN Configuration Steps:

1. **Define security policies** (encryption algorithms).
2. **Configure IKE (Internet Key Exchange)** for key management.    
3. **Set up tunnel mode** for secure data transfer.
4. **Apply access control** to restrict VPN users.
5. **Test and monitor** the VPN connection.
