(a) Key Differences Between Firewalls, IDS, and IPS

 ![](../../images/Screenshot%20from%202025-07-06%2011-17-16.png)
1. Functionality:

	- Firewall: Acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks, filtering traffic based on predefined rules (e.g., IP/port).
	- IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators (passive).
	- IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): Actively blocks detected threats in real-time (active).

2. Placement:

	- Firewalls are deployed at network boundaries.
	- IDS is placed inline or passively to analyze traffic copies.
	- IPS is deployed inline to intercept and block malicious traffic.

3. Response:
	
	- Firewalls prevent unauthorized access but do not detect exploits.
	- IDS detects but does not block attacks.
	- IPS detects and blocks attacks automatically.

(b) Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) vs. Traditional Firewalls

- Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): NGFWs analyze packet content (e.g., malware, apps) beyond just headers.
- Integrated Features: NGFWs combine firewall, IDS/IPS, VPN, and application-aware filtering.

**(a) Authentication Process with Diagram**  
**Components**:

1. Supplicant (client device).
2. Authenticator (switch/AP).
3. Authentication Server (RADIUS server).
    
**Process**:
	1. Client connects to the switch (blocked port).
	2. Switch requests credentials via EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol).
	3. Credentials forwarded to RADIUS server.
	4. Server validates credentials and sends approval/denial to the switch.
	5. Switch grants/denies access.

> [!NOTE]- EAP & EAPoL
>  ```text
> 1. EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)
> 
> Definition: A flexible authentication framework used in 802.1X to validate users/devices before granting network access.
> Key Points:
> - Works over multiple mediums (LAN, WLAN, VPN).
> - Supports multiple authentication methods (EAP types):
>     - EAP-TLS (Certificates, most secure)
>     - PEAP (Password + TLS tunnel)
>     - EAP-MD5 (Weak, deprecated)
> - Role in 802.1X: Carries authentication messages between the supplicant (client) and authentication server (RADIUS).
>     
> 
> Why EAP?
> - Allows different authentication mechanisms without changing infrastructure.
> - Encapsulated inside EAPoL for LAN/WLAN use.
> 
>  2. EAPoL (EAP over LAN)
> 
> Definition: A protocol that encapsulates EAP messages for transmission over wired/wireless LANs (used in 802.1X).
> 
> Key Points:
> - Used only at the link layer (between supplicant & authenticator).
> - Does not travel end-to-end (RADIUS server communicates with authenticator separately).
> - Four Key EAPoL Message Types:
>     1. EAPoL-Start (Client initiates authentication)
>     2. EAPoL-Key (Used for WPA/WPA2 key exchange)
>     3. EAPoL-Packet (Carries EAP authentication data)
>     4. EAPoL-Logoff (Terminates session)
>         
> How EAPoL Works in 802.1X:*
> 1. Supplicant sends EAPoL-Start** to the authenticator (switch/AP).
> 2. Authenticator responds with EAPoL-Request Identity.
> 3. Supplicant sends credentials via EAPoL-Packet.
> 4. Authenticator forwards EAP data to RADIUS server.
> 5. RADIUS approves/denies access → Authenticator grants/denies port access.
> ```

**b) Component Collaboration**

- `Supplicant` provides credentials.
- `Authenticator` enforces access control.
- `Server` validates credentials centrally.  
    Together, they ensure only authenticated devices access the network.

**(a) Three Layer 2 Threats**

![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020250706142348.png)

1. `MAC Flooding`: Attacker overloads the switch’s MAC table, forcing it to act as a hub and broadcast traffic.
2. `VLAN Hopping`: Exploits misconfigured trunk ports to access restricted VLANs.
3. `ARP Spoofing`: Attacker sends fake ARP replies to intercept traffic.
    

**(b) Port Security Configuration**

1. Enable port security on the switch:
    
```
 switch(config-if)# switchport port-security
```  
    
2. Set maximum MAC addresses:

```
switch(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum 2
```

3. Set aging

```
switch(config-if)# switchport port-security aging type inactivity
```
    
4. Define violation action (e.g., shutdown):
    
```
switch(config-if)# switchport port-security violation shutdown
```  
    
5.  Save configuration.

![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020250706141235.png)**Selected Categories**:

**1. Network Segmentation (4 Marks)**

Implementation:
- VLANs for Departments: Segment the network into VLANs (e.g., Doctors, Admin, Patient Records) to isolate traffic and limit lateral movement during breaches.
- DMZ for Public Services: Place web servers or email systems in a DMZ to separate them from internal databases.
- Micro-Segmentation: Use software-defined networking (SDN) for granular control over east-west traffic in cloud environments.
    
Why?  
Prevents attackers from accessing sensitive data (e.g., EHRs) even if one segment is compromised.

**2. Access Control (4 Marks)**

Implementation:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assign permissions based on roles (e.g., doctors read/write to EHRs, admins manage systems).
- 802.1X Authentication: Require device and user authentication via RADIUS before granting network access.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforce MFA for all remote and administrative logins.
    
Why?  
Ensures only authorized personnel access critical systems, reducing insider threats and credential theft.

---

**3. Data Security (4 Marks)**

Implementation:
- Encryption:
    - At Rest: Use AES-256 encryption for patient data in databases and cloud storage.
    - In Transit: Enforce TLS 1.3 for all communications (e.g., EHR access, VPNs).
        
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Deploy DLP tools to monitor and block unauthorized transfers of sensitive data (e.g., HIPAA-covered records).
    
Why?  
Protects patient confidentiality and complies with regulations like HIPAA/GDPR.

---

 **4. Remote Access (4 Marks)**

Implementation:
- Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA): Replace traditional VPNs with ZTNA to grant least-privilege access to applications (not the entire network).
- VPN with MFA: For legacy systems, use IPsec/SSL VPNs with certificate-based authentication and MFA.
- Endpoint Security: Require MDM (Mobile Device Management) for BYOD devices to enforce encryption and remote wipe capabilities.
    

Why?  
Secures telemedicine and remote workflows while minimizing attack surface.

---

**5. Cloud Security (4 Marks)**

Implementation:
- CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker): Monitor SaaS applications (e.g., Office 365) for shadow IT and enforce policies.
- Shared Responsibility Model: Configure IAM roles, encryption, and WAFs in AWS/Azure to protect patient data in the cloud.
- Backup and DR: Regular encrypted backups with immutable storage to mitigate ransomware.
    
Why?  
Addresses shared cloud risks and ensures data availability.

---
**Additional Measures (Bonus for Depth)**

- Security Awareness Training: Regular phishing simulations for staff.
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): Centralized logging for real-time threat detection (e.g., Splunk, Sentinel).
- Penetration Testing: Annual red-team exercises to identify vulnerabilities.

---

**Conclusion (Balanced Security & Access)**

This design prioritizes:
- Security: Segmentation, encryption, and strict access controls.
- Usability: ZTNA and MFA enable secure remote access without hindering workflows.
- Compliance: Aligns with HIPAA, GDPR, and industry best practices.
        
Additional Measures:
- Regular audits and employee training on phishing.
