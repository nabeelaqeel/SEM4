### **Comparison with Cisco Firewalls**
Cisco offers firewalls such as **Cisco ASA** (Adaptive Security Appliance) and **Cisco Firepower NGFW**, which are widely used in enterprise environments. In comparison to the above vendors:

- **Fortinet & Palo Alto** offer improved AI/ML-based threat detection than Cisco's traditional firewalls.
- **Check Point** offers improved cloud integration, whereas Cisco requires additional configurations.
- **pfSense & OPNsense** are cost-effective, acting as open-source alternatives to Cisco's licensing system.
- **Sophos XG** is easier to use for SMBs, while Cisco solutions are complex and require professional experience.

Cisco leads in enterprise networks due to its ecosystem (i.e., integration with Cisco ISE, Umbrella), but rivals provide better pricing and cloud-native features.
