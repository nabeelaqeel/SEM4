### Objectives
- Research and identify social engineering attacks
### Background / Scenario
- Social engineering is an attack with the goal of getting a victim to enter personal or sensitive information, this type of attack can be performed by an attacker utilizing a keylogger, phishing email, or an in-person method. This lab requires the research of social engineering and the identification of ways to recognize and prevent it.
### Required Resources
- PC or mobile device with internet access
### Instructions
- Using a web browser find the article “Methods for Understanding and Reducing Social Engineering Attacks”  on the SANS Institute website. A search engine should easily find the article. 
- The SANS Institute is a cooperative research and education organization that offers information security training and security certification. The SANS Reading Room has many articles that are relevant to the practice of cybersecurity analysis. You can join the SANS community by creating a free user account to access to the latest articles, or you can access the older articles without a user account. 
- Read the article or choose another article on social engineering, read it, and answer the following questions:

### Questions:

- What are the three methods used in social engineering to gain access to information?
	1. Electronic access
		- Phishing
		- Spear phishing
		- Baiting
	2. Physical Access
		- Pretexting
		- Tailgating
		- Quid  Pro Quo
	3. Social Media

- What are three examples of social engineering attacks from the first two methods in the previous question?
	- Phishing
	- Pretexting
	- Tailgating

- Why is social networking a social engineering threat?
	- Social networking is a social engineering threat because users often share personal information that attackers can exploit to guess security questions, craft targeted spear-phishing emails, or create fake profiles to build trust.

- How can an organization defend itself from social engineering attacks?
	- Plan the training
	- Perform personality testing 
	- Design the security awareness program
	- Develop the security awareness program
	- Implement the security awareness program

- What is the SANS Institute, which authored this article?
	- The SANS Institute is a private U.S. for-profit company founded in 1989 that specializes in information security, cybersecurity training, and selling certificates.
