The malware encrypted files on infected systems and demanded a $300 ransom (later increased) in Bitcoin to restore access. Fortunately , The attack was brought to a halt on the evening of the 12 of May by a cyber researcher who had activated a kill switch .

WannaCry exploited a Windows vulnerability (EternalBlue) in the SMB protocol, allowing it to spread like a worm across networks. Once inside a system, it encrypted files and displayed a ransom note, threatening permanent data loss if payment wasnâ€™t made.  

The impact of the attack is financial losses where it was estimated at $4 billion due to downtime and recovery cost. Next , operational disruption where this attack has disrupt hospital , business and government agency where they faced shutdown .
